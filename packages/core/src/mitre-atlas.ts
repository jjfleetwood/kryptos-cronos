      overview: [
        "MITRE ATLAS (Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems) is what ATT&CK is to traditional IT, but for AI and ML systems — a structured, real-world matrix of the tactics and techniques adversaries use against models rather than servers. It exists because the attack surface it covers is exploding: as machine learning moves into security tooling, autonomous vehicles, medical diagnostics, and financial decisioning, every one of those models becomes a target with failure modes that classic security frameworks never anticipated. ATLAS gives defenders a shared vocabulary for threats that don't look like anything in ATT&CK.",
        "The lifecycle opens, as ATT&CK's does, with reconnaissance — AML.TA0001 — but the things an attacker wants to learn are different. Instead of network topology, they're after the shape of the model: its architecture (AML.T0000), the sources of its training data (AML.T0001), and its exact input/output format (AML.T0002), and they'll probe its decision boundaries with carefully chosen queries to map how it thinks. Understanding *how* a model was built and *what* it learned is the foundation every later ML attack is constructed on.",
        "Like IT recon, ML reconnaissance is mostly passive, turning active only when it has to. Passively, the attacker reads what's freely published — API documentation, research papers, the model's code on GitHub, its HuggingFace model card — often learning almost everything they need without sending a single request. Actively, they query the model's API with crafted inputs to infer its architecture, read its confidence scores, and trace its decision boundaries from the outside. The progression mirrors traditional recon: learn quietly from public sources first, and only poke the target directly once you know precisely what to poke.",

The kit includes substitute (proxy) models that mimic the target, adversarial-example generators, poisoned datasets staged for supply-chain attacks, and the infrastructure to run model-extraction campaigns at scale. As with ATT&CK's resource development, none of this touches the victim yet; it's the lab work that makes the later attack possible.",
        "The centerpiece is the substitute model (AML.T0005) — a local clone trained to imitate the target. The attacker builds it by repeatedly querying the target's API and using its responses as training labels, effectively distilling the target's behavior into a model they fully control. The payoff is profound: adversarial examples crafted against a good substitute often *transfer* to the real model, letting the attacker defeat a system whose weights and architecture they've never seen. The substitute turns a black-box target into a white-box one they can attack at will.",

CleverHans, Foolbox, the Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART), and TextFooler for NLP were all built by academics to *study* and *defend against* model vulnerabilities — and every one of them is readily pointed at a production system instead.

        "Initial Access (AML.TA0003) is the first foothold into an ML system or its pipeline, and the most powerful vector is one traditional security barely contemplates: AML.T0010, ML Supply Chain Compromise. Rather than break into the target, the attacker seeds malicious models, poisoned datasets, or backdoored libraries into the open ecosystem and waits for victims to download and deploy them. The compromise arrives pre-installed, carried in by the victim's own 'just grab the popular model' workflow.",
        "Public model registries make this disturbingly easy. HuggingFace hosts well over 500,000 models, and a typosquatted lookalike of a popular one — a name a single character off — can end up deployed by thousands of organizations who never check provenance. The key difference from a classic supply-chain attack is that no vendor compromise is required at all: the attacker doesn't need to breach a trusted company, they just upload a convincing lookalike to a public hub and let the ML community's download-and-load culture do the rest.",
        "Two more routes round out initial access. AML.T0012 (Valid ML Service Credentials) is the use of compromised API keys for cloud ML services — the AI equivalent of stolen credentials, granting direct access to a hosted model. And AML.T0047 (Backdoor ML Model via GitHub) slips a hidden backdoor into open-source *training* code, so that anyone who trains a model from that repository unknowingly bakes the attacker's trigger into their own model. Together they show the breadth of the AI supply chain's trust surface: the model, the credentials, and the code that builds it are all attack vectors.",

      overview: [
        "ML Model Access (AML.TA0004) describes how much visibility an attacker has into the model they're attacking — and it's a spectrum, not a yes/no. At one end is white-box access, where the attacker holds the model's weights and architecture and can compute against it directly. At the other is pure black-box access: inputs go in, outputs come out through an API, and everything in between is hidden. Where an attacker sits on this spectrum shapes which techniques are available to them, which is why ATLAS treats access as a tactic in its own right.",
        "Black-box access (AML.T0040) is the common real-world case for commercial ML — and the sobering lesson of ATLAS is that it's still plenty to work with. With nothing but query access, an attacker can map decision boundaries through systematic probing, run membership-inference to extract who or what was in the training set, craft adversarial examples by transferring them from a substitute model, and coax out sensitive training data with carefully shaped inputs. 'You only exposed an API' turns out to be far weaker protection than most deployers assume.",
        "For large language models, black-box access opens a qualitatively richer attack surface than it ever did for image classifiers. Because the input is natural language, the attacker has enormous expressive control: black-box access enables prompt injection (AML.T0054), jailbreaking past safety guidelines, and data-extraction attacks, all expressed in ordinary words. An image classifier accepts only pixels; an LLM accepts arguments, role-play, and instructions — so the same 'just an API' exposure becomes a vastly larger and more creative attack space.",

        "Execution (AML.TA0005) is the moment the attack fires — making the ML system produce a wrong or harmful output on demand. Its primary technique is AML.T0015 (Craft Adversarial Data): inputs that look completely normal to a human but are engineered to push the model to a confident, wrong prediction. There's no malware and no exploit in the traditional sense; the 'payload' is a perfectly ordinary-looking image, audio clip, or sentence that the model misreads catastrophically.",
        "What makes this possible is the geometry of neural decision boundaries. In the very high-dimensional space where a model represents its inputs, the boundary between 'panda' and 'gibbon' is a complicated surface, and a tiny perturbation nudged in exactly the right direction can cross that boundary while remaining utterly imperceptible to a person. The canonical demonstration is precisely that: adding a layer of imperceptible noise turns a clear photo of a panda into a 'gibbon' classified at 99.3% confidence on ResNet. The model isn't confused — it's confidently, measurably wrong, and the human can't see why.",
        "The real-world impact is broad and physical, not just academic. Adversarial perturbations have made autonomous-vehicle perception read a stop sign as a speed-limit sign, let malware shift its features to evade ML antivirus, fooled face-recognition systems with specially-patterned 'adversarial glasses,' and slipped prohibited images past content-moderation models. Each is the same core flaw — a model's confidence and a human's perception diverging — landing somewhere a wrong answer has real consequences. That gap is the central danger ATLAS exists to make defenders take seriously.",

As defenders increasingly lean on machine learning (malware classifiers, network anomaly detectors, spam and NSFW filters), those models become targets, and attackers craft inputs tuned to slip past the specific model standing guard. The defensive AI doesn't make the system safer by default; it adds one more model that can be attacked.",
        "Evading an ML malware detector (AML.T0015.002) is a precise operation: keep the payload's malicious behavior, edit only the features the classifier judges by. These detectors score binaries on features like byte n-grams, entropy, and API-call sequences, so adversarial ML produces functionally-identical malware variants whose feature profile has been shifted just below the classifier's detection threshold. The file still does exactly what the attacker wants — it just no longer looks malicious to the model measuring it.",
        "This is an arms race, and ATLAS draws a sobering conclusion from it. Defenders train a detector, attackers learn to evade it, defenders add adversarial training to harden it, attackers find a new evasion — the cycle never closes. The deeper point is one every team adopting AI-based security should internalize: ML-based defenses are not inherently more robust than the signature-based ones they replace. They trade one set of weaknesses for another and, crucially, introduce a brand-new attack surface — the model itself — that the old approach never had.",

        "Discovery (AML.TA0007) widens the attacker's view from the model to the entire ML pipeline around it — and that's the point, because the model is only one component of a long chain. The pipeline includes training-data sources, preprocessing, the model registry, deployment infrastructure, monitoring, and feedback loops, and each of those components is its own potential attack vector. An attacker who maps the whole pipeline can pick the weakest link rather than fighting the model head-on.",
        "So discovery is about finding the stage that's easiest to subvert. The attacker probes data ingestion (AML.T0001 — acquire or poison the training data), feature preprocessing (inject adversarial features before the model ever sees them), the model registry (swap in a backdoored model), the serving layer (intercept and modify responses in transit), and the feedback loops (corrupt the data the system logs and later retrains on). Any one of these, compromised, can poison or hijack the model without touching the model directly.",
        "How discovery is performed depends on access. With some reach, the attacker reads the pipeline straight from the artifacts that describe it — pipeline documentation and config files, model-metadata endpoints, and CI/CD definitions (a GitHub Actions workflow alone can reveal the data sources, the training steps, and the deployment path). With no access, they infer the pipeline's shape from the model's behavior, reasoning backward from outputs to architecture. Either way, the goal is the same: a map of every component, so the attacker can choose where to strike.",

Classic collection harvests files and databases; ML collection extracts what the model has *memorized* during training. The model isn't a passive store of data — it's a lossy, queryable compression of everything it learned, and an attacker can interrogate it to pull that information back out, even when the original data is long gone or strictly access-controlled.",
        "Membership Inference (AML.T0024) asks a deceptively simple question: was this specific sample part of the training set? With only a data sample and black-box access, the attacker can decide member versus non-member by reading how confidently and characteristically the model responds to it. That sounds abstract until you ground it: run membership inference against a model trained on medical records and you learn whether a particular patient's record was used to train it — a serious privacy breach achieved without ever seeing the record itself.",
        "Model inversion (AML.T0026) goes further still, reconstructing the training data rather than just confirming its presence. From black-box access, inversion rebuilds approximate representations of the samples a model was trained on — and the canonical result is chilling: against a face-recognition model, inversion has reconstructed *recognizable faces* of the people in its training set from the class embeddings alone. The model was supposed to be an anonymous function from face to identity; inversion turns it back into the faces.

The targets are the learned intelligence captured in the weights — taken via model stealing (AML.T0056, Model Replication) or gradient leakage (AML.T0024, Gradient Inversion). The crown jewel of an AI company isn't a database; it's the model that cost millions to train, and ATLAS recognizes that an attacker can walk out with that asset without ever copying a single file.",

The attacker queries the target enough times and trains a substitute on the responses until the substitute matches the target's held-out accuracy — at a tiny fraction of the original training cost. For a commercial AI product whose entire competitive moat is its model, that's direct intellectual-property theft: a competitor (or anyone) can reconstruct your expensively-trained model from the outside, then deploy it as their own.",

Federated learning was designed for privacy: clients share *gradients*, not raw data, with a central aggregator, so the training data supposedly never leaves the device. Gradient inversion shatters that guarantee — it reconstructs the original training samples from the shared gradients alone, leaking exactly the private data the architecture was built to protect. The privacy-preserving mechanism turns out to carry the private data in encoded form, and the attacker who intercepts the gradients can decode it back.",

The techniques span the model's lifecycle: AML.T0020 (Backdoor ML Model) plants a hidden trigger that forces misclassification on command; AML.T0031 (Poison Training Data) corrupts the data so the model degrades or learns bias; and AML.T0048 (Erode ML Model Integrity) achieves slow corruption through feedback loops. The damage might be a model that fails on the attacker's secret cue, a model that's quietly biased, or a model that simply gets worse over time.",
        "Data poisoning (AML.T0031) is worth dwelling on because it attacks the *training pipeline* rather than the deployed model — it shapes what the model becomes before it's ever served. By injecting corrupted samples into the training data, an attacker can degrade overall accuracy (an availability attack), force targeted misclassification of specific inputs (an integrity attack), or introduce demographic bias (a fairness attack). One poisoning technique, three distinct harms, all decided at training time and baked permanently into the weights.",
        "The most dangerous variant is the slowest: corruption through a feedback loop. Many production systems retrain on their own outputs — a recommender learns from what it surfaced, a model learns from the data it logged. An attacker who can nudge those outputs steers the model toward malicious behavior over many retraining cycles, a little at a time. It's the hardest impact to catch precisely because nothing fails suddenly: the metrics decay gradually, drift looks like normal model aging, and by the time anyone notices, the model has been walked somewhere it was never supposed to go. Catching it requires monitoring for drift and treating retraining data as a security-critical input.",

      year: 2024,
      overview: [
        "This capstone stitches ATLAS's eleven tactics into a single adversarial lifecycle for AI, the same way the ATT&CK kill chain reads end to end. The path runs: reconnaissance of the ML system → resource development → initial access → model access → execution → defense evasion → discovery → collection → attack staging → exfiltration → impact. Seen as a whole, it's a complete playbook — every stage from 'learn how the model works' to 'inflict the intended harm' — and it's the map a defender uses to reason about where in that chain they have visibility and where they don't.",
        "But real attacks never march down that list in order; they pivot opportunistically on what they discover, and the famous cases each emphasize a different slice. Clearview AI is reconnaissance and collection at staggering scale (3 billion scraped faces) fused with exfiltration, because the scraped faces *are* the training data. Microsoft's Tay chatbot was discovery of a feedback loop turned straight into impact — coordinated users poisoned it into producing hateful output within hours. And GPT-4 training-data extraction research is model access leveraged into exfiltration. The tactics are building blocks, not a script; attackers assemble whichever ones the target's weaknesses allow.",
        "Finally, ATLAS has a defensive counterpart, and pairing them is the whole point: the NIST AI Risk Management Framework. Where ATLAS catalogues what attackers do, the AI RMF structures how defenders respond — MAP (understand the context and the risks), MEASURE (assess them), MANAGE (mitigate and respond), and GOVERN (own the accountability). Use ATLAS to know your threats and the AI RMF to organize your defenses, and the two together turn 'AI security' from a vague worry into a practiced, mappable discipline as rigorous as the one the industry built around traditional IT.",
