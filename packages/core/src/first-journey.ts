        "You're driving west on I-80 through Denver. At every highway interchange, a sign tells you: take this exit for San Francisco, stay on I-80 for Salt Lake City. You make decisions at each junction. A router does exactly this — it reads a packet's destination IP address and decides which interface to forward it out of, based on a routing table.",
        "The internet has no central controller. Millions of routers each make independent forwarding decisions based on their local routing tables. Your packet might hop through 15 different routers between Denver and Santa Cruz, each one reading only the destination IP and sending it one step closer.",
        "Routing tables are built dynamically using protocols like BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) — the protocol that keeps the global internet's routing maps synchronized. When Facebook's BGP routes were accidentally deleted in 2021, every router on the internet forgot how to reach Facebook.",

          "Routers vary enormously in scale:\n- Home routers are simple — everything local stays on the LAN, everything else goes to your ISP.\n- Core internet routers at major exchange points carry tables with 900,000+ routes and forward millions of packets per second in hardware.",

          "The TCP handshake has an inherent flaw: when a server receives a SYN, it allocates memory for the half-open connection and waits for the ACK that completes the handshake. If the ACK never comes — because the source IP was spoofed — the server waits (typically 75 seconds) before releasing that memory.",
          "A SYN flood sends millions of SYN packets with fake source IPs. The server fills its connection table with half-open connections and can no longer accept legitimate traffic. This attack exploits the protocol design itself — TCP's designers in the 1970s never anticipated malicious actors. Modern mitigations include SYN cookies, which avoid allocating memory until the handshake completes.",
