There is no single perfect stance — great hitters trigger it differently:\n- Mookie Betts uses a gentle toe-tap to time his load.\n- Shohei Ohtani employs a dramatic high leg kick to generate torque.\n- Some of the best contact hitters in history barely moved their feet at all.\nWhat all great stances share is balance, a clear view of the pitcher, and a reliable way to trigger the swing on time.",
        "Feet should be set slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, pointing toward the plate or slightly open. Knees are bent so that the hips are loaded and ready to fire. Weight sits evenly on the balls of both feet — neither on the heels (which causes slow reaction) nor on the toes (which causes forward lurch). The body faces the plate at roughly a 45-degree angle to the pitcher, keeping both eyes forward.",
        "Hand position is critical. Hands start near the back shoulder, bat angled at roughly 45 degrees behind the head. The grip is firm but relaxed — tension in the hands travels up into the forearms and kills bat speed. The knocking knuckles (middle knuckles of both hands) align on the handle. From this position, the hitter can load back and launch forward into any pitch in the strike zone.",

The most common triggers are:\n- the toe-tap (front foot lifts and sets down as the pitcher enters delivery — used by Mookie Betts and many top hitters)\n- the leg kick (front leg lifts dramatically to generate hip torque — Shohei Ohtani, Josh Hamilton)\n- the weight shift (slight backward weight shift onto the back foot without lifting — more common in contact-oriented hitters)\n- the no-trigger (quiet stance with minimal movement — used by some elite contact hitters)",
          "The purpose of any trigger is timing and loading: getting the weight onto the back side at the right moment so that the hips and hands can fire forward in sync with the pitch. A good trigger is consistent — the same movement every pitch — so the rest of the swing is reliable. Youth players should experiment to find a simple, repeatable trigger rather than copying a complex Major League kick that is difficult to time.",

Research shows that batters must begin their swing decision by the time the ball is roughly halfway to the plate — leaving about 175 milliseconds to identify pitch type, location, and speed. This is not enough time for conscious analytical thinking. Elite hitters develop pattern recognition so deeply trained that pitch identification is nearly automatic.",

All pitches — fastball, curveball, slider, changeup — start on nearly the same trajectory out of the pitcher's hand. They share a common 'tunnel' of flight for the first 20–25 feet. After that, spin and physics cause them to diverge. A pitcher who keeps all pitches through the same tight tunnel is far more effective because the hitter cannot identify the pitch until it has already diverged — giving them far less time to adjust.",

        "The modern understanding of swing mechanics has been transformed by Statcast data, which measures bat speed, launch angle, and exit velocity on every batted ball in Major League Baseball. The key insight: the most valuable contact — line drives and hard-hit fly balls — comes from a swing plane that matches the pitch's downward trajectory, creating a larger contact window rather than a smaller one. This is why the old-school coaching cue 'swing down on the ball' is now understood to produce poor contact, not good contact.",
        "Hip rotation remains the engine of the swing. As the stride foot lands, the back hip fires forward and upward (sometimes described as 'clearing the hips'), pulling the hands and bat into the contact zone. The sequence is ground-up:\n- Back foot plants.\n- Ankle rotates ('squish the bug').\n- Knee drives inward.\n- Hip fires.\n- Core rotates.\n- Shoulders come through.\n- Hands stay palm-up and palm-down through contact.\n- Bat head arrives at the ball.\nBreaking the chain at any link reduces power.",
        "The contact zone — where the bat meets the ball — is ideally out in front of the body for pull pitches, at the plate edge for middle pitches, and deep (near the back hip) for away pitches. Hitters who try to pull everything make contact too early or too late on away pitches; hitters who stay deep make contact too far back on inside pitches. Reading pitch location and adjusting contact point is a skill developed through thousands of repetitions.",

Statcast research shows that balls hit between 10 and 30 degrees of launch angle produce the highest batting averages and slugging percentages — these are the hard line drives and medium fly balls that either drop for hits or leave the park. Balls hit at 0 degrees (perfectly flat) are usually ground balls, easy outs. Balls hit above 30 degrees are pop-ups — high and easily caught.",
          "Achieving optimal launch angle requires a slight upward swing plane — the bat traveling slightly upward through the contact zone to match the pitch's downward angle. This creates maximum overlap between bat and ball at the moment of contact. The old cue 'swing down' was meant to prevent pop-ups but actually produced ground balls. Modern instruction focuses on 'attack angle' — matching the bat path to the pitch's approach angle for the largest possible contact window.",

The combination of Statcast analytics showing the value of hard contact at optimal launch angles, more aggressive strength and conditioning programs, and refined hitting instruction has produced the most power-hitting era in baseball history. Exit velocities above 100 mph are now common at the professional level, and home run rates remain historically high despite various equipment adjustments.",
        "Bat speed is the most direct driver of exit velocity — the faster the bat is moving at contact, the harder the ball comes off. Bat speed is generated primarily through:\n- Hip rotation speed.\n- Hip-to-hand separation.\n- The length and efficiency of the swing path.\nHeavier bats do not automatically generate more exit velocity — a hitter who can swing a lighter bat faster will often outperform someone struggling to whip a heavy bat through the zone.",
        "The Dodgers have built their lineup around power since the mid-2010s. Cody Bellinger, Max Muncy, Corey Seager, Justin Turner, and Shohei Ohtani have all been products of a philosophy that prizes hard contact to all fields but especially to the pull side in the air. Understanding the difference between pull power (hitter-friendly, high exit velocity by getting the barrel to the ball early) and opposite-field power (requires elite bat speed to drive the ball with authority away) is central to developing a power approach.",

Because the swing is still accelerating at this contact point (the bat has not yet fully decelerated), and because the barrel has more centrifugal force at the front of the swing, pull contact produces the highest exit velocities. This is why most home runs are pulled — the physics favor it.",
          "Opposite-field power is the signature of elite bat speed. To drive an outside pitch to the opposite field with authority, the hitter must wait longer (contact is deeper in the zone, near the back hip), maintain hip rotation through contact, and extend the arms fully through the ball going the other way. Hitters with slower bat speed who try to pull outside pitches produce weak grounders to the shortstop side. Staying back and driving the other way with authority requires both mechanical excellence and genuine bat speed.",

With no strikes or one strike, a hitter can be selective and look for something specific; with two strikes, the at-bat changes and the hitter must protect the plate.

      year: 1988,
      overview: [
        "Hitting a fastball is fundamentally a timing problem. A 95-mph pitch arrives at the plate in approximately 400 milliseconds; a 100-mph pitch in roughly 375 milliseconds. A hitter's swing from initiation to contact takes 150–160 milliseconds. That means a hitter must begin their swing — committing hip rotation — before the ball is even halfway to the plate. The margin for error is less than 10 milliseconds between a solid contact and a foul tip.",
        "The key to hitting hard fastballs is not strength — it is timing, and timing is trained through repetition — several methods build it:\n- Pitching machines set to 85–90 mph.\n- At-bats against live fastball pitchers.\n- Overload/underload bat training: swing a heavier bat, then a lighter bat, then the game bat.\nThese all develop the neural patterns that allow a hitter to be on time consistently. Hitters who are late on fastballs are not necessarily slow — they are often simply not committed early enough.",
        "Keeping hands inside the ball is the most critical mechanical cue for fastball hitting. On a fastball, the barrel of the bat needs to arrive at the contact zone through the shortest possible path — not a long, looping arc. 'Inside the ball' means the hands stay close to the body as they travel toward the contact zone, so the barrel enters the hitting zone from the inside out, making contact on the inner half of the ball and driving it with backspin. Casting the hands (letting them drift away from the body early) creates a long path that is always late on fastballs.",

Set a machine at game speed (or slightly above game speed for overload training) and focus on tracking the ball from the machine's release slot — not from the arm slot a live pitcher would use. The weakness of machine training is that it removes pitch recognition cues: there is no deception, no tunnel point, no release point variation. Machine reps build timing mechanics; live pitching builds timing plus recognition.",
          "The best fastball training drill is the 'fastball only' at-bat: take rounds of BP where you know only fastballs are coming, and focus entirely on being on time, driving the ball hard to all fields. This separates timing from recognition — you can groove the mechanics of fastball hitting without the cognitive load of pitch identification. Once the mechanics are grooved, add breaking balls back to complete the picture.",

      year: 1963,
      overview: [
        "Breaking balls — curveballs, sliders, changeups, and their variants — are designed to exploit a hitter's timing. They all start on similar trajectories to fastballs (the tunnel-point principle) but arrive slower and/or in different locations. The most common mistake is early commitment — firing the hips before the pitch has identified itself, which produces one of two bad swings:\n- Too early — a rolled-over grounder.\n- Too far in front — a big swing-and-miss.\nThe antidote is patience: stay back until the break reveals itself.",
        "The curveball is the classic early-commitment trap. It starts high, looking like a fastball in the upper zone, then drops dramatically into or below the strike zone. Hitters who react to the initial 'high fastball' trajectory fire early and swing at where the ball started — not where it ends up. The key to hitting curveballs is staying back: delaying hip rotation until the ball's break has been identified, then making a shorter, adjusted swing to the ball's actual arrival location.",
        "Two pitches give hitters the most trouble at the highest level:\n- The SLIDER has tight spin that looks like a fastball's backspin but carries a lateral tilt, cutting late to the glove side — many hitters call it a 'fastball that disappears' in the final 10–15 feet.\n- The CHANGEUP looks like a fastball by design — same arm speed, same trajectory — but arrives 8–12 mph slower.\nEarly commitment is fatal against both.",

This late action makes sliders very difficult to hit. The cue: sliders cut to the arm side of the plate at the end; a ball that starts middle and appears to be fading inside (for a right-handed batter against a right-handed pitcher) is a slider. Changeup: Fastball trajectory at fastball arm speed but 8–12 mph slower. The gravity makes it drop more than a fastball, often breaking away from same-side batters.

At roughly 40 feet from the plate — where the tunnel diverges — the curveball begins its catastrophic 58-inch vertical drop while the fastball continues on a flat line. Hitters who commit their hip rotation early, reading 'fastball,' are already firing by the time the ball begins dropping.",

The hitters who have the most success against Kershaw are those who can stay back on the curveball long enough to identify it and then react to its final location — a skill that requires exceptional patience and quick-twitch adjustment.",

        "A well-structured hitting routine has multiple components:\n- Tee work — stationary ball, pure mechanics focus.\n- Soft toss — timing against a moving ball from close range.\n- Front toss — timing against a more realistic trajectory.\n- Live BP — full timing against a pitcher's delivery.\n- Video review — comparing your mechanics against your goals and against professionals.\nEach component builds a different aspect of the hitting skill set.",
        "Video analysis is no longer just for professional players. Every smartphone can record at 240 frames per second — more than enough to analyze swing mechanics in slow motion. Youth players and coaches who use video systematically — comparing pre-session mechanics to post-session mechanics, tracking improvements over weeks and months — develop hitters far faster than those who rely on feel alone. The key: watch the video with a specific focus (hip rotation, hand path, head position) rather than general review.",

          "The batting tee allows a hitter to freeze the ball in any location — inner half, outer half, up, down, high, low — and take 50 swings at that exact location without any timing element. This isolates mechanics completely. A hitter who struggles with inside pitches can take 100 tee reps with the ball on the inner third of the plate, grooving the hip rotation and early contact point required for that pitch. No other drill allows this precision.",
          "Tee drills for specific development:\n- Inner half drill — tee at front of plate, inner half; focus on hip rotation and early contact.\n- Outer half drill — tee at back edge of plate, outer half; focus on staying back and driving the other way.\n- High fastball drill — tee at shoulder height; focus on a short swing path and staying above the ball.\n- Low pitch drill — tee at knee height; focus on getting the swing plane down without losing hip rotation.",

        impact: "The Dodgers' hitting development infrastructure under coaches like Robert Van Scoyoc (who worked with Mookie Betts, Clayton Kershaw on batting mechanics, and others) combined Statcast data with traditional tee and cage work to create one of the most systematic hitter development programs in professional baseball.",
        body: [
          "The Dodgers' approach to hitting development integrates data and traditional work more deliberately than almost any other franchise. During spring training and the regular season, hitters receive daily Statcast reports — exit velocity by pitch zone, launch angle distribution, swing rate by pitch type. This data informs which tee drills to run that day: if a hitter's exit velocity on outer-half pitches is declining, they run outer-half tee sessions. If launch angle is dropping below 10 degrees, the hitting staff runs high-tee and launch angle drills.",
          "The Dodgers also pioneered the use of real-time video — iPads positioned in the dugout allow hitters to review at-bats immediately between innings, comparing their swing to pre-game plan mechanics. This feedback loop has significantly shortened adjustment cycles: where it once took a week for a hitter to recognize and correct a mechanical problem, it now takes an inning. Youth players can approximate this system with a smartphone on a tripod in the batting cage — the technology is accessible, but the discipline to use it consistently is what distinguishes great development programs.",

Feeling and reality often diverge significantly — many hitters feel they are keeping their head down but video shows clear early lift. Identifying 'head lifts before contact' gives you a specific, testable cue: 'see the bat hit the ball.' You take 20 tee reps focusing only on that cue, then re-record and compare. This feedback loop accelerates development dramatically. At 240fps on a modern phone, this is available to any youth player.",
