## Stage Structure

Every stage follows this four-part flow:

### 1. Stage Briefing (StageInfo component)
- **Overview:** Plain-language explanation of the vulnerability or concept
- **Attack Flow Diagram:** Visual showing attacker → system → victim → outcome
- **Technical Deep Dive:** Mechanism, code examples, how it works
- **Historical Incident:** The real-world breach or case study that made this topic relevant
- **Timeline:** Key events in the incident
- **References:** CVE entries, OWASP links, MITRE ATT&CK/ATLAS entries, post-mortems

### 2. CTF Challenge (CtfChallenge component)
- Simulated bash terminal
- Filesystem modeled on the real affected system (e.g., Log4Shell-vulnerable logging server)
- Built-in commands: `ls`, `cat`, `cd`, `submit`, `hint`, `help`, `pwd`, `clear`
- Stage-specific commands implemented as TypeScript closures in stage data files
- Progressive hints: up to 3, revealed one at a time via `hint`
- ARIA chatbot available for AI-assisted coaching

### 3. Reference Drawer
- Slide-in panel available during CTF — full briefing accessible without leaving the terminal
- Models how real security professionals work (documentation always open)

### 4. Completion
- XP awarded server-side (computed from STAGE_XP map in `/api/progress`, not client-submitted)
- Badge unlocked (displayed on leaderboard and stage map)
- Skills Acquired summary shown in FlagSuccessModal
- Streak updated in Redis; milestone badges checked (m-xp-1k, m-xp-5k, m-streak-3, m-streak-7)
- Next stage unlocked in sequence
