## The Problem

Cybersecurity talent is in structural shortage. There are currently **3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity positions globally** (Cybersecurity Ventures, 2025), and that number is growing faster than any traditional training institution can address. Simultaneously, the threat landscape is accelerating: AI-assisted attacks, zero-day exploits, and state-sponsored intrusions are outpacing the defenders.

Existing training solutions fail on two fronts:

1. **Certification-focused platforms** (CompTIA, ISC²) teach to exams, not to real-world threat response. Completion rates are below 15%.
2. **Enterprise security training** is universally described by employees as compliance theater — checkbox activities with no retention or behavior change.

The result is a workforce that knows *about* security but cannot *do* security.

---

## The Opportunity

Kryptós CronOS is a **gamified, AI-personalized cybersecurity and AI-safety training platform** targeting three converging markets:

| Market | Size (2025) | CAGR |
|---|---|---|
| Cybersecurity workforce training | $14.8B | 14.2% |
| Enterprise e-learning platforms | $37.9B | 19.6% |
| AI literacy & upskilling | $6.1B | 32.4% |
| K-12 & higher-ed cyber/STEM education | $6.6B | 16.5% |

We are building at the intersection of all four — and the fourth unlocks a second product angle (see *The Talent Pipeline*, below): the same engine that prepares working professionals also feeds the workforce from the K-12 source.

## Product

### Core Experience

Kryptós CronOS delivers training through **stage-based missions** that simulate real attacks and real defenses. Each stage follows a four-part structure:

1. **Threat Briefing** — A detailed, technically accurate overview of a vulnerability class: its history, how it works mechanically, and the real-world incident where it caused maximum damage (Target breach, Equifax, WannaCry, Log4Shell, SolarWinds, OPM).

2. **Attack Flow Visualization** — An interactive diagram showing the attacker, the compromised system, the victim, and the outcome. System-generated from structured data, not stock illustrations.

3. **Capture the Flag (CTF) Challenge** — A simulated bash terminal environment where the learner must exploit or investigate the exact vulnerability described in the briefing — replicas of real environments from documented incidents.

4. **ARIA AI Tutor** — A live, stage-aware AI assistant (powered by Claude Haiku) that uses Socratic coaching: it answers questions and guides thinking without giving away the flag. Available throughout every challenge.

### Curriculum — 801 Stages across 72 Epochs and 16 Tracks (v1.43.0)

## Business Model

### B2C (Direct to Learner)
- **Free tier:** Stages 1–3 (acquisition funnel)
- **7-day free trial** — full access; converts to paywall after 7 days; no credit card required to start
- **Pro:** $13.99/month or $99/year (SAVE 41%) — full curriculum + adaptive AI + badge certificates. Billing via **Stripe (web) + RevenueCat (iOS/Android IAP)**, unified entitlement
- **Team:** $12/seat/month (10+ seats) — cohort dashboards, completion reporting

#### Ad-Supported Hints — Revenue Model Detail

Each stage provides one hint at no cost. Hints 2 and 3 require either a 30-second sponsor ad or a Pro subscription upgrade. Ads are contextually matched to stage content: endpoint detection vendors appear on malware stages; cloud security providers appear on SSRF and misconfiguration stages. This drives premium CPMs ($50–$200) against a verified security practitioner audience.

At 50,000 free users with an average of 0.5 ad impressions per session, projected revenue is approximately $2,500/month, scaling linearly with user growth at zero marginal cost. The hint friction point is the highest-intent moment in the product — every ad impression doubles as a Pro upgrade conversion opportunity.

### B2B (Enterprise)
- **Enterprise:** $8/seat/month (100+ seats) — SSO, compliance reporting, custom curriculum, dedicated success manager
- Target: Fortune 500 security teams, defense contractors, financial services firms under SEC cybersecurity disclosure rules (effective 2024)

### Sponsor Integration (Ecosystem Revenue)
Strategic sponsors — security tools vendors (CrowdStrike, Cisco, SentinelOne), cloud providers (AWS, Azure), and certification bodies (CompTIA, ISC²) — can:
- Sponsor specific stage badges ("Powered by CrowdStrike — Threat Hunter Badge")
- Offer co-branded certificates redeemable for exam discounts
- Run sponsored challenge weeks with custom CTF scenarios
- Access anonymized aggregate learner skill data (with consent) for workforce insights

This creates a tripartite flywheel: learners build skills → employers find certified talent → vendors reach a qualified security audience.

#### Cisco — Flagship Sponsor Integration

Cisco is the deepest planned sponsor relationship, anchored by a 60-stage Cisco curriculum built across 5 epochs (Core CVEs, Enterprise Defense, SecOps, Advanced Defense, and Umbrella DNS Security) and expanding across four product lines:

| Integration | Product | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Weekly CVE Challenge | **Cisco Talos** | Talos threat feed drives new CTF scenario weekly — co-branded "Talos Threat of the Week" |
| DNS & Network Security Track | **Cisco Umbrella** | Dedicated epoch: DNS tunneling, DGA, and network policy stages |
| Enterprise SecOps Track | **Cisco SecureX / XDR** | Alert triage and incident response stages modeled on SecureX workflows |
| Network Defense Stages | **Cisco Firepower / NGFW** | Firewall exploitation and lateral movement scenarios |
| Certification Alignment | **Cisco CyberOps Associate** | Cisco epoch completions map to CyberOps exam domains; live readiness tracker at /cyberops; Cisco provides exam vouchers |
| API Security Track | **Cisco DevNet** | REST API exploitation and OAuth misconfiguration stages |

## Second Product Angle — The Cybersecurity Talent Pipeline (K-12 → University)

The 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs are usually framed as a hiring problem. They are a **supply** problem — and supply is set years before anyone applies. The same engine that prepares working professionals for CompTIA, ISC², and Cisco certifications can introduce a ten-year-old to passwords, phishing, and online safety, then carry that learner all the way to a professional credential. That is a second product built on the curriculum and gamification platform we have already shipped.

**Age-tiered curriculum, one engine.** The platform's category-aware presentation and group-based content tiers are designed to deliver the same security concept at four reading levels — elementary, junior high, high school, and university — each with age-appropriate framing, vocabulary, and challenges. A CIA-triad lesson becomes "keep your secret safe, unchanged, and reachable" for a fourth-grader and a controls-and-trade-offs analysis for an undergraduate. The tiering infrastructure is built; the tiered content is a fast-follow.

**Distribution: institutions, not individuals.** This angle is sold to organizations that serve young learners at scale:
- K-12 school districts and state departments of education (CTE / career-technical-education cyber pathways)
- After-school programs, cyber clubs, and library STEM initiatives
- GenCyber-style summer camps and regional workforce-development boards
- Community colleges bridging students into four-year and certificate programs

**Why it's fundable.** It converts a B2C funnel into an institutional one with grant-backed budgets (NSF GenCyber, CISA cyber education, state cyber-workforce initiatives); it dramatically lengthens learner lifetime (a user can enter at age 10 and stay in the funnel through professional certifications); and it gives the company a mission narrative — closing the workforce gap at its source — that resonates with education funders, ESG-minded sponsors, and public-sector buyers the cert-prep product alone does not reach.

**Revenue.** District/site licensing on a per-student or per-seat annual basis, grant-funded cohort deployments, and sponsor-underwritten free access for Title I schools (a natural extension of the existing sponsor-integration flywheel).
