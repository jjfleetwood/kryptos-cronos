## The Problem

Cybersecurity talent is in structural shortage. There are currently **3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity positions globally** (Cybersecurity Ventures, 2025), and that number is growing faster than any traditional training institution can address. Simultaneously, the threat landscape is accelerating: AI-assisted attacks, zero-day exploits, and state-sponsored intrusions are outpacing the defenders.

Existing training solutions fail on two fronts:

1. **Certification-focused platforms** (CompTIA, ISC²) teach to exams, not to real-world threat response. Completion rates are below 15%.
2. **Enterprise security training** is universally described by employees as compliance theater — checkbox activities with no retention or behavior change.

The result is a workforce that knows *about* security but cannot *do* security.

## The Opportunity

Kryptós CronOS is a **gamified, AI-personalized cybersecurity and AI-safety training platform** targeting three converging markets:

| Market | Size (2025) | CAGR |
|---|---|---|
| Cybersecurity workforce training | $14.8B | 14.2% |
| Enterprise e-learning platforms | $37.9B | 19.6% |
| AI literacy & upskilling | $6.1B | 32.4% |

We are building at the intersection of all three.

## Product

### Core Experience

Kryptós CronOS delivers training through **stage-based missions** that simulate real attacks and real defenses. Each stage follows a four-part structure:

1. **Threat Briefing** — A detailed, technically accurate overview of a vulnerability class: its history, how it works mechanically, and the real-world incident where it caused maximum damage (Target breach, Equifax, WannaCry, Log4Shell).

2. **Attack Flow Visualization** — An interactive diagram showing the attacker, the compromised system, the victim, and the outcome. Not a stock illustration — a system-generated diagram built from structured data.

3. **Capture the Flag (CTF) Challenge** — A simulated bash terminal environment where the learner must exploit or investigate the exact vulnerability described in the briefing. The flag is hidden in a filesystem modeled on the actual 2014 Heartbleed server, the 2021 Log4Shell-vulnerable logging infrastructure, or the 2019 Capital One AWS metadata endpoint.

4. **Reference Panel** — Available at any point during the challenge. A slide-in panel containing the full briefing, technical reference, and attack diagram — modeling how real security professionals work with documentation open.

### Curriculum (12 Stages, v1.0)

| Stage | Topic | CVE / OWASP | XP |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | CIA Triad Foundations | — | 100 |
| 2 | AI Threat Detection | — | 150 |
| 3 | SQL Injection | OWASP A03, Heartland 2008 | 200 |
| 4 | Cross-Site Scripting | Samy Worm 2005 | 200 |
| 5 | Heartbleed | CVE-2014-0160, CVSS 7.5 | 250 |
| 6 | Broken Access Control | OWASP A01, AT&T iPad 2010 | 250 |
| 7 | Authentication Failures | LinkedIn 2012, 117M records | 250 |
| 8 | Log4Shell | CVE-2021-44228, CVSS 10.0 | 300 |
| 9 | WannaCry / EternalBlue | CVE-2017-0144, 150 countries | 300 |
| 10 | SSRF | OWASP A10, Capital One 2019 | 300 |
| 11 | Apache Struts / Equifax | CVE-2017-5638, 147M records | 350 |
| 12 | MongoDB Misconfiguration | OWASP A05 | 350 |

### Progression & Gamification

- **Linear gating:** Stages unlock sequentially. Learners cannot skip ahead.
- **XP system:** Every completed stage awards XP toward a cumulative score.
- **Badge library:** Each stage unlocks a unique badge (e.g., "AI Scout," "SQL Slayer," "Zero Day Hunter").
- **Leaderboard:** Real-time competitive ranking against peers, driving return engagement.
- **Streaks & milestones:** Planned for v1.1 — daily login streaks, weekly challenge events.

## AI Personalization (Roadmap)

The current platform is a strong foundation. The defensible moat is the AI layer being built on top of it:

### Adaptive Difficulty
Using an AI API, the platform will analyze a learner's command patterns, flag submission attempts, and time-on-task to dynamically adjust challenge difficulty. A learner who immediately exploits the SQL injection gets pushed to blind SQLi and second-order injection. A learner who struggles gets targeted hints and scaffolded sub-challenges.

### Personalized Learning Paths
Rather than a fixed 12-stage sequence, AI models each learner's knowledge gaps and professional context (developer, sysadmin, executive, student) to recommend the optimal next challenge. A developer gets SQL injection and XSS first. A sysadmin gets network security and misconfiguration. An executive gets social engineering and business impact scenarios.

### AI Tutoring
An in-terminal AI assistant (AI API) that responds to natural-language questions during CTF challenges — without giving away the answer. "What does this log entry mean?" gets an educational explanation. "Just tell me the flag" gets a Socratic redirect.

### Threat Intelligence Feed
Weekly AI-generated challenge updates based on real CVEs published in the past 7 days. Learners are always training on current threats, not historical case studies.

## Business Model

### B2C (Direct to Learner)
- **Free tier:** Stages 1–3 (acquisition funnel)
- **Pro:** $19/month or $149/year — full curriculum + AI personalization + badge certificates
- **Team:** $12/seat/month (10+ seats) — cohort dashboards, completion reporting

### B2B (Enterprise)
- **Enterprise:** $8/seat/month (100+ seats) — SSO, compliance reporting, custom curriculum, dedicated success manager
- Target: Fortune 500 security teams, defense contractors, financial services firms under SEC cybersecurity disclosure rules (effective 2024)

### Sponsor Integration (Ecosystem Revenue)
Strategic sponsors — security tools vendors (CrowdStrike, Palo Alto, SentinelOne), cloud providers (AWS, Azure), and certification bodies (CompTIA, ISC²) — can:
- Sponsor specific stage badges ("Powered by CrowdStrike — Threat Hunter Badge")
- Offer co-branded certificates redeemable for exam discounts
- Run sponsored challenge weeks with custom CTF scenarios
- Access anonymized aggregate learner skill data (with consent) for workforce insights

This creates a tripartite flywheel: learners build skills → employers find certified talent → vendors reach a qualified security audience.
