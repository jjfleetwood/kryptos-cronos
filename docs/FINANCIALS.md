## R&D Investment to Date (Development Hours)

AI-assisted development compresses build time dramatically but produces real economic value. This section tracks the equivalent developer cost of work completed — useful for understanding total platform investment and demonstrating AI leverage to investors.

> Full session-by-session breakdown: see HOURS_LOG.md in admin docs panel.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **Total development hours** | 25.0 h |
| **Equivalent developer cost** | $3,750 (25 h × $150/hr market rate) |
| **Actual AI tool cost** | ~$60 (Claude Code MAX amortized) |
| **AI leverage ratio** | ~62× value created per dollar spent |
| **Platform features shipped** | 831 stages, 75 epochs, 12 cert paths, resume builder, adaptive AI tutor, voucher system, Stripe + RevenueCat payments, **cross-platform monorepo + native iOS/Android app (Expo, pre-store)**, Supabase auth, push notifications, Plausible analytics, full security audit |

**Total R&D investment (cash + sweat equity equivalent): ~$3,810**

### What This Tells Investors

A platform this complete (typical comp: $800K–$1.5M to build with a traditional team) was built for ~$800 in cash and ~$60 in AI tooling. The $3,750 developer-equivalent figure is conservative — it reflects only logged sessions, not pre-Atlas work. The AI leverage ratio of 62× is the core efficiency story of this company.

| Traditional build cost estimate | Actual cost | Leverage |
|---|---|---|
| 3 engineers × 3 months × $15K/mo = $135K | $800 cash + $3,750 sweat equity | 36× cash, 62× AI |

## Unit Economics (Per Paying User)

What one Pro subscriber is worth and what they cost.

### Monthly subscriber ($13.99/mo)

| Item | Amount |
|---|---|
| Gross revenue | $13.99 |
| Stripe fee | −$0.71 |
| **Net revenue** | **$13.28** |
| Anthropic ARIA (est. 20 hints/mo × $0.001) | −$0.02 |
| Upstash amortized | −$0.01 |
| **Gross margin per user** | **~$13.25 (~95%)** |

### Annual subscriber ($99/yr = $8.25/mo effective)

| Item | Amount |
|---|---|
| Gross revenue | $99.00 |
| Stripe fee | −$3.17 |
| **Net revenue** | **$95.83** |
| Anthropic ARIA (est. 240 hints/yr × $0.001) | −$0.24 |
| **Gross margin per user** | **~$95.59 (~97%)** |

> **Gross margins of 95%+ are exceptional.** This is the standard SaaS software advantage — infrastructure cost per user is near-zero at current scale. Protect this by keeping COGS items rate-limited and capped.

Steps to establish proper financial hygiene before investor due diligence.

- [x] **Confirm 83(b) election in process** — Atlas confirmed in dashboard: expected postmark June 9, 2026. Watch for confirmation email.
- [ ] **Verify registered agent is active** — Legalinc via Atlas. Renewal due May 2027.
- [ ] **Set up Stripe revenue tracking** — connect Stripe to Wave when first payment comes in.
- [ ] **Keep receipts for all formation costs** — Stripe Atlas $500, copyright $65, API usage $25 are all deductible business formation expenses.
