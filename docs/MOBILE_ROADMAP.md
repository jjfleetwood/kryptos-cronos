# Kryptós CronOS — Cross-Platform / Mobile Roadmap

**Last reviewed:** 2026-06-13

**Status:** Planning
**Created:** 2026-06-03
**Goal:** Take Kryptós CronOS from a web app to a real, sellable cross-platform product — Next.js web + Expo (React Native) mobile, sharing one backend, monetized via RevenueCat (mobile IAP) + Stripe (web).

> **Cardinal rule:** Do not build the mobile app until the backend can serve it cleanly (Phase 1). Each phase unblocks the next.

---

## Why this architecture (and not the cheaper options)

The good news: ~80% already exists. The backend (Next.js API routes + Upstash Redis + Supabase Auth + Anthropic + Stripe) is effectively a REST backend a mobile client can consume, and the 831 stages are structured TypeScript data that's reusable as-is.

- **PWA / Capacitor are stopgaps, not endgames.** PWA = no store presence, weak iOS. Capacitor (thin web wrapper) ages badly and risks Apple "thin wrapper" rejection; the CTF terminal's keyboard UX fights touch. Fine to *test* with, wrong to *build a company on*.
- **Retention is native.** A learning app lives on push-driven re-engagement (streak nudges, daily challenge). The gamification layer (XP, streaks, trophies) only pays off with native push — a website can't pull that lever well.
- **Store presence = trust + discoverability** for a paid product.

**Verdict:** Turborepo monorepo → shared backend → Next.js web stays → Expo mobile app → RevenueCat (mobile) + Stripe (web) → Supabase as the single identity system.

---

## Phase 0 — Decisions & accounts (before any code)

| Decision | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Monetization model | Accept IAP on mobile via **RevenueCat**, keep **Stripe on web**. Steer high-intent users to web checkout (higher margin); let mobile impulse-buyers use IAP. |
| Auth source of truth | **Supabase** becomes the single identity system; retire reliance on HMAC cookies for cross-platform. (Already running Supabase in parallel — this is a finish, not a start.) |
| Analytics | Swap planned Plausible for **PostHog** — web + mobile, funnels, retention cohorts, feature flags from one SDK. |
| Store accounts | Enroll now (lead time): Apple Developer ($99/yr), Google Play ($25 once). Use **Bolotin Enterprises, Inc.** for an Organization account. |

**Exit:** model chosen, store accounts enrolled, RevenueCat + PostHog accounts created.

## Phase 1 — Make the backend multi-client (the keystone) · ~1–1.5 wks

API routes today assume a same-origin web client with cookies. Mobile is cross-origin and token-based.

- **Token auth:** make `getServerSession()` accept **either** the HMAC cookie **or** `Authorization: Bearer <supabase-jwt>`. This is the change that lets a phone talk to the existing API.
- **Freeze the API contract:** namespace (`/api/v1/*`) or lock response shapes. Mobile apps can't be force-updated; a breaking response breaks installed apps.
- **Confirm no cookie-only dependencies** in data routes (`/api/progress`, `/api/leaderboard`, `/api/check-flag`, `/api/check-answer`, `/api/hint`). Keep XP/flag validation server-side (never trust the mobile client either).
- **In-app account deletion** already exists (`/api/delete-account`) — Apple requires it.

**Exit:** every gameplay endpoint works with a bearer token, no cookie.

### Phase 1 — STATUS: shipped v1.25.0 (2026-06-03). Remaining follow-ups:

The core keystone is done and verified live (bearer→cookie resolver, email-claim identity, `/api/auth/bootstrap`, 16 routes migrated, CORS). Open items before Phase 1 is 100% closed:

- [ ] **Positive-path E2E test with a real Supabase JWT** — only the negative path (bogus token → 401), CORS preflight, and origin-allowlist were verified live. Still need: sign in via Supabase SDK with a test account → call a gameplay endpoint with the live token → confirm identity resolves + `bootstrap` provisions a new Supabase-only user. Needs a throwaway test account (or mint one via the service-role key).
- [x] **`getUser()` → local JWKS verification — DONE.** `verifySupabaseJwt` now verifies the JWT locally against the project JWKS (`jose`, cached) as a fast path, falling back to `supabaseAdmin.auth.getUser()` when local verify can't apply (symmetric-key project / JWKS hiccup). Never less correct than before; trade-off is the fast path trusts signature+expiry (no mid-token revocation check, fine for ~1h tokens).
- [x] **API contract freeze / `/api/v1` — DONE.** `next.config.ts` rewrites `/api/v1/:path*` → `/api/:path*`; `@kryptos/api-client` (the mobile client) now pins to `/api/v1`. A future breaking change ships under `/api/v2` while `/api/v1` stays frozen. Web still calls `/api/*` directly (unaffected).
- [x] **Env var reconciliation** — ✅ done 2026-06-03. Confirmed the code reads only `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` / `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (server-side; no `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*` and no browser Supabase client). Fixed CLAUDE.md's env list and added the (previously missing) Supabase block to `app/.env.example`. ⚠️ Verify the same names are set in Vercel.
- [ ] **Document the mobile auth handshake** (for Phase 4): app does Supabase `signUp({ email, password, options: { data: { username }}})` → `signInWithPassword` → `POST /api/auth/bootstrap` with the bearer token → thereafter send `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` on every API call; refresh the token via the Supabase SDK before expiry (~1 h).
- [ ] **Token revocation note** — a Supabase access token stays valid until expiry; the server cannot cheaply revoke a single JWT. Acceptable for short-lived tokens; revisit if longer-lived tokens are used. (Logout is client-side: drop the token + Supabase `signOut`.)

---

## Phase 2 — Monorepo extraction · ~1–1.5 wks

```
apps/
  web/        ← current app/ moves here (web client + the API stays here)
  mobile/     ← Expo app (Phase 4)
packages/
  core/       ← types, stage DATA, cert-domains, difficulty, client-safe access logic
  api-client/ ← one typed fetch layer both apps import
```

- Use **Turborepo**.
- **Critical boundary:** server-only modules (`stage-flags.ts`, `crypto-utils.ts`, `redis.ts`) stay in `apps/web` — they must NEVER land in `packages/core` (would leak flags to clients). Mirror the existing `stages.ts` (full) vs `stages-meta.ts` (client-safe) split exactly.

**Exit:** web builds/deploys unchanged from the monorepo; `packages/core` imports cleanly with zero server-only leakage.

### Phase 2 — STATUS: built on branch `phase-2a-monorepo` (2026-06-03), NOT yet merged/deployed.

- [x] **2a — monorepo skeleton.** `app/ → apps/web` (rename kept `node_modules`/`.env.local` intact), root npm workspaces + `turbo.json` (`packageManager` pinned), lockfile at root, `@kryptos/web` package, CI rewritten for workspaces, `/deploy` skill paths updated, hardened root `.gitignore`. Build/tsc/lint green.
- [x] **2b — `packages/core`.** Whole `src/data` layer moved (51 `.ts` + json + batch dirs, 200 files); 91 `@/data/*` refs across 38 web files rewired to `@kryptos/core/*`. Consumed via `transpilePackages` + `@kryptos/core/*` tsconfig path + source `exports` (`./*` wildcard handles nested `translations/*`; explicit entries for the two `.json`). **Server-only boundary holds** — `stage-flags.ts` lives in core but only the `check-flag` server route imports it (build would fail on a client leak). Build/tsc/lint green.
- [x] **2c — `packages/api-client`.** Framework-agnostic `createApiClient({ baseUrl, getToken, fetch })` — bearer token (mobile) or cookies (web); typed methods: `getMe`, `bootstrap`, `getProgress`, `awardStage`, `getLeaderboard`, `checkFlag`, `checkAnswer`, `getHint` + generic `request<T>` escape hatch. Types mirror the live route handlers. tsc green. (Web keeps its direct fetches; mobile is the first consumer in Phase 4.)
- [ ] **2d — shared tsconfig/eslint config package** — optional, skipped for now.
- [x] **Vercel root-dir cutover + merge — DONE 2026-06-03.** Vercel Root Directory set to `apps/web`; preview of the merge commit (`89fc2bf`) built green; merged `phase-2a-monorepo → dev → master`; production verified ✓ (`master @ 89fc2bf`, Ready; homepage/leaderboard/certs 200, auth 401). Required a build fix: `supabaseAdmin` is now **lazily** constructed so `next build` page-data collection doesn't need Supabase env (Preview env lacked it). **Phase 2 fully shipped to production.**

---

## Phase 3 — Unify subscriptions · ~1 wk

So "is this user Pro?" has one answer regardless of where they paid.

- Mirror the two Stripe products ($13.99/mo, $99/yr) as App Store + Play products in RevenueCat.
- Add a **RevenueCat webhook** that writes `tier=pro/free` to Redis — exactly like the existing Stripe `checkout.session.completed` webhook.
- Make `getUserTier()` the single reconciler (Stripe entitlement OR RevenueCat entitlement OR active voucher), keyed by Supabase user id.

**Exit:** buy on web → Pro on phone; buy on phone → Pro on web; restore purchases works.

### Phase 3 — STATUS: backend foundation shipped 2026-06-03.

- [x] **RevenueCat webhook** — `POST /api/webhooks/revenuecat` (`apps/web/src/app/api/webhooks/revenuecat/route.ts`). Authorization-header verified against `REVENUECAT_WEBHOOK_AUTH` (constant-time). Maps `event.app_user_id` (= our lowercase username) → Redis. Grant events (INITIAL_PURCHASE/RENEWAL/UNCANCELLATION/PRODUCT_CHANGE/NON_RENEWING_PURCHASE) → `tier=pro` + `rcProExpiry` + clears `voucherExpiry`; EXPIRATION/SUBSCRIPTION_PAUSED → `tier=free`. Ignores anonymous `$RCAnonymousID` users. tsc/build green; deployed.
- [x] **Unified entitlement** — `getUserTier()` already reconciles via the shared `tier` field (Stripe + RevenueCat + voucher all write it); added an `rcProExpiry` lapse backstop mirroring `voucherExpiry`.
- [x] **Env** — `REVENUECAT_WEBHOOK_AUTH` added to `.env.example` + CI placeholder + CLAUDE.md.
- [ ] **⚠️ RevenueCat dashboard setup (you, when ready):** create a RevenueCat project; add an entitlement `pro`; create App Store + Play products mirroring $13.99/mo + $99/yr and attach to `pro`; add the webhook (URL `https://kryptoscronos.com/api/webhooks/revenuecat`, Authorization header = `REVENUECAT_WEBHOOK_AUTH` value, also set that env var in Vercel); the Phase 4 app calls `Purchases.logIn(username)` so `app_user_id` = our username.
- [x] **Multi-source entitlement — FIXED.** Per-source flags (`proStripe`, `rcProExpiry`, `voucherExpiry`): each revoke webhook only sets `tier=free` if no *other* source is still active, and `getUserTier` returns Pro if any source is active (only downgrades on a lapsed time-boxed stamp with no other active source). No more cross-platform downgrade.
- Note: most of Phase 3 only goes *live* once Phase 4 (the app) exists and the RC dashboard is configured — this is the backend foundation, same as Phase 1 auth preceded the app.

## Phase 4 — Mobile MVP (Expo) · ~3–4 wks

- Scaffold `apps/mobile` with **Expo + Expo Router** (file-based routing — same mental model as the App Router). **Supabase RN SDK** for auth; tokens in `expo-secure-store`.
- **Ship Quiz-mode first, defer the CTF terminal.** Every stage already has an 8-question quiz (v1.23.0) and quizzes are natively touch-friendly. The CTF terminal is keyboard/desktop-shaped — keep it on web/tablet for v1.
- MVP surface: auth → stage map → stage briefing (render the structured `overview` / `technical` / `incident` / `takeaways`) → **quiz** → leaderboard → profile/XP/streak. **ARIA tutor** ports almost free (chat UI over `/api/hint`).

**Exit:** a real user can sign up, complete quiz stages, earn XP, and appear on the leaderboard — entirely on a phone.

### Phase 4 — STATUS: scaffold shipped to branch `phase-4-mobile` 2026-06-03 (NOT merged).

- [x] **`apps/mobile` scaffolded** — Expo SDK 56 / RN 0.85 / expo-router, inside the monorepo. `metro.config.js` (watchFolders = workspace root, `unstable_enablePackageExports`) resolves `@kryptos/core` + `@kryptos/api-client`. React pinned to match web; **web still builds** (verified).
- [x] **Auth** — `src/lib/supabase.ts` (RN client, AsyncStorage session, url-polyfill), `src/lib/auth.tsx` (AuthProvider: signIn/signUp w/ username metadata → calls `/api/auth/bootstrap`), `src/lib/api.ts` (`createApiClient` w/ bearer token from the Supabase session, baseUrl = prod).
- [x] **Screens** — auth gate + `login`, tab nav (`stages` grouped by epoch w/ completion ticks · `leaderboard` · `profile` w/ tier/coins/streak/sign-out), minimal `stage/[id]` detail. tsc green.
- [x] **Interactive quiz screen — DONE.** `stage/[id].tsx` renders a 5-question shuffled attempt from `stage.quiz` (`getStage` from `@kryptos/core/stages`), submits option **text** to `api.checkAnswer` (server validates — quizzes are 0-XP/cosmetic so the bundled `correctIndex` is harmless, same posture as web), shows per-question correct/incorrect + explanation, and a completion screen (half-clear for dual-mode CTF stages, +XP/badge for pure-quiz). tsc green. Mirrors web `QuizChallenge`.
- [x] **ARIA hint chat — DONE.** `components/AriaChat.tsx` — slide-up Modal chat opened via a 💬 header button on the quiz screen; sends stage context (scenario/hint/chatbotContext/keyTakeaways/tagline) to `api.getHint`, renders ARIA replies, and respects the server's adaptive `nextCooldownS`. Mirrors web `HintChatbot`. tsc green.
- [x] **Push notifications — DONE** (Phase 5; see Phase 5 status).
- [x] **RevenueCat IAP screens — DONE.** `lib/purchases.ts` (configure / `logIn(username)` so app_user_id matches the webhook / offerings / purchase / restore, entitlement `pro`); paywall at `app/upgrade.tsx` (offerings + prices + restore); configured in `_layout`, identified in `auth.tsx`, reachable via a "⭐ Kryptós Pro" button on Profile. Env: `EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_IOS_KEY` / `_ANDROID_KEY`. tsc green. **Needs a dev build to run** (react-native-purchases is native — not Expo Go) + the RC dashboard products/offering + keys.
- [ ] **NEXT — Phase 6 store launch** (EAS build/submit, store assets, review). CTF terminal stays web/tablet for v1. Re-enable `typedRoutes` after first `expo start`.
- [ ] **`typedRoutes` is temporarily OFF** — re-enable in `app.json` after the first `npx expo start` generates `.expo/types`.
- [ ] **Run it (yours):** `cd apps/mobile && npm install && npx expo start` on a dev machine; set `apps/mobile/.env` (EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL/ANON_KEY). Cannot be run/verified in this environment (no simulator). Merge to `master` only after it runs on a device.
- Pairs with Phase 3's RevenueCat dashboard setup (the app calls `Purchases.logIn(username)` once IAP screens are added).

---

## Phase 5 — Native retention layer · ~1.5 wks

- **Push notifications** (Expo Notifications): streak-expiry nudges, daily challenge, new-content alerts. The core reason mobile beats web for a learning app.
- Offline caching of stage content, deep links, app icon/splash reusing the `Logo.tsx` watch-dial mark.

**Exit:** streak reminders measurably lift D1/D7 retention in PostHog.

### Phase 5 — STATUS: push notifications shipped to branch `phase-4-mobile` 2026-06-03.

- [x] **Mobile registration** — `src/lib/notifications.ts` (expo-notifications): permission prompt → Expo push token → `POST /api/push/register`. Wired into `auth.tsx` (registers on sign-in/app-start; `unregisterPush` on sign-out). Plugin added to `app.json`.
- [x] **Backend** — `src/lib/push.ts` (Expo Push API sender), `POST/DELETE /api/push/register` (stores token in `push:tokens` hash, auth'd), and `GET /api/push/streak-reminder` (CRON_SECRET-bearer guarded): enumerates `push:tokens`, finds users whose streak `lastDate` == yesterday with `current >= 1`, and nudges them.
- [x] **Schedule** — `apps/web/vercel.json` cron at `0 23 * * *` (daily 23:00 UTC) hits the reminder. Env: `CRON_SECRET` (added to `.env.example` + CI + CLAUDE.md). tsc + web build green.
- [ ] **You, before it fires:** set `CRON_SECRET` in Vercel; run `eas init` so the app gets a real `projectId` for Expo push tokens (dev works on a physical device). Vercel Cron requires the appropriate plan.
- [ ] **Deferred:** daily-challenge / new-content notifications, offline caching, deep links (the streak nudge is the highest-leverage one and is done).

---

## Phase 6 — Store launch · ~1–1.5 wks (incl. review latency)

- Review prep: privacy nutrition labels, in-app account deletion (have it), reviewer demo account, screenshots. Expo's native UI sidesteps "thin wrapper" rejection.
- **EAS Build/Submit** wired into CI (extends existing GitHub Actions). Phased rollout.
- Fires TODO items **I (launch campaign)** and **J (first paying user)**.

**Exit:** live in both stores.

### Phase 6 — STATUS: build config scaffolded 2026-06-03 (branch `phase-4-mobile`). The rest needs your accounts.

**Done (config in repo):**
- [x] `apps/mobile/eas.json` — build profiles (`development` dev-client, `preview` internal, `production` autoIncrement) + `submit.production` placeholder.
- [x] `app.json` store identifiers — `ios.bundleIdentifier` + `android.package` = `com.kryptoscronos.app`, `buildNumber`/`versionCode` = 1, `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption: false` (skips the export-compliance prompt). Plugins for splash / secure-store / notifications already set.

**You run (needs Expo + Apple + Google accounts — external, can't be done from here):**
1. `npm i -g eas-cli` → `eas login` → from `apps/mobile`: `eas init` (creates the Expo project; writes `extra.eas.projectId` — also the real push `projectId`).
2. Set EAS env/secrets: `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_*` (e.g. `eas env:create` or an `.env` for the build profile).
3. `eas build --profile preview --platform all` → install the dev/preview build on a device (RevenueCat + push need a real build, not Expo Go). **Re-enable `typedRoutes` in `app.json` and run `expo start` once to generate `.expo/types`.**
4. App Store Connect + Google Play Console: create the app, the **IAP products** ($13.99/mo, $99/yr) and link them to the RevenueCat `pro` entitlement/offering; set the RC dashboard webhook + `REVENUECAT_WEBHOOK_AUTH` + Vercel `CRON_SECRET`.
5. Store listing: screenshots, description, **privacy nutrition labels**, demo reviewer account, IAP review notes. In-app **account deletion** already exists (Profile → … or via API) — Apple requires it.
6. `eas submit --profile production --platform all` → phased rollout. Fires TODO **I (launch campaign)** + **J (first paying user)**.

**Note:** wiring EAS build into GitHub Actions is deferred — do manual `eas build` first; automate once the pipeline is proven.

---

## Phase 7 — B2B track (parallel, stays on web)

The `$8/seat` enterprise model is a **web** product: seat management, SSO (Google Workspace / SAML), admin dashboards. Mobile is the consumer channel; enterprise buyers never wanted an app. Run independently whenever a pilot (TODO item L) materializes.

---

## Cross-cutting (every phase)

- **Sentry** error monitoring on both clients.
- **PostHog** events from day one of the app.
- Keep the **content-reformat grind (CR2)** running in parallel — content quality, independent of app work, improves both clients at once.

## Timeline (solo, AI-assisted)

**~3 months to a store-launched MVP.** Critical path: Phases 1→2→3 (~3–4 wks) are prerequisites, then the app (4→5→6, ~6–7 wks). Phase 7 is opportunistic.

## Explicit non-goals

- ❌ Capacitor/PWA as the endgame (fine as a throwaway test).
- ❌ Porting the web UI to React Native — web stays Next.js.
- ❌ Building the app before Phase 1 (token auth). Everything downstream depends on it.

## Strategic note

The moat is the **content + cert-readiness mapping + AI tutor**, not the app shell — the app is distribution. The business is split: B2C (mobile retention shines) vs B2B (web admin/SSO). Build mobile *alongside* web, never *instead of* it.
