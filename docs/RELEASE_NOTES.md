# Kryptós CronOS — Release Notes

---

## v1.6.2 — 2026-05-20

**Draggable feedback widget**

- **FeedbackWidget** — header bar is now a drag handle; widget can be repositioned anywhere on screen; position persists to localStorage across reloads; clamped to viewport bounds; cursor changes to grab/grabbing during drag; label updated to "Comments? New content?"

---

## v1.6.1 — 2026-05-20

**Docs consolidation and CAE advisory content**

- **Docs single source of truth** — `docs/` is now the authoritative directory; deploy skill syncs `docs/*.md` → `app/secured-docs/` on every deploy, eliminating manual drift between the two directories
- **`PITCH_CAE_CONTINUOUS_MONITORING.md`** — new advisory paper for Chief Audit Executives on continuous monitoring via AI agents; draws on all 24 CM 1.0 + CM 2.0 module incident anchors; covers agentic audit layer (Claude tool use, API enumeration, secrets detection) and detection stack (SIEM, UEBA, NDR, CSPM, SOAR, SOC maturity); no product pitch — positions the practice and framework
- **Deploy skill updated** — step-by-step sync instruction and docs-first editing rule codified in `app/.claude/commands/deploy.md`

---

## v0.7.0 — 2026-05-15

**Multi-step CTF engine, job outcomes homepage, hints monetization, investor targeting**

- **Fragment collection system** — multi-step CTF mechanic: each stage now hides flag fragments behind file reads and exploit commands; `assemble` built-in reveals the full flag only after all fragments are collected; 🔑 N/M counter badge in terminal header
- **All 54 stages retrofitted** — Our First Journey (bt-01–bt-30), Foundations (stage-01–12), and Cisco (stage-m01–12) all have `fragments` arrays; `solved: true` pattern removed from all extraCommands; flags no longer appear in command output
- **Homepage job outcomes section** — "Train for jobs that are hiring right now" career section added: SOC Analyst, Penetration Tester, Cloud Security Engineer, AppSec/Secure Dev; each card shows salary range, required skills, and which stages cover them
- **Stats updated** — hero badge and stats bar reflect 54 stages, 12+ real CVEs, 3.5M unfilled cyber jobs
- **Hints-as-ads monetization** — Candy Crush model documented in both business proposals: first hint free, hints 2–3 require 30-second sponsor ad or Pro upgrade; $50–$200 CPM; contextual ad matching by stage topic
- **PITCH_TARGETS.md** — new investor targeting document: Tier 1 (ForgePoint, SYN Ventures, ClearSky, Owl, Reach Capital, Cisco Investments), Tier 2 (Bessemer, General Catalyst, Greylock, CrowdStrike, Paladin, a16z), Tier 3 (YC, NSF SBIR, CISA); competitive positioning table and warm intro paths
- **Admin docs viewer** — Pitch Targets tab added; `PITCH_TARGETS.md` added to `ALLOWED_FILES` allowlist

---

## v1.5.4 — 2026-05-19

**CTF scroll fix, feedback email, widget layout, 24-stage MCP templates**

- **CTF terminal scroll** — fixed black-screen terminal not scrolling: added `min-h-0` to wrapper and `overscrollBehavior: contain` to output container; inner flex overflow now works correctly inside nested flex layouts

  - **Agentic epoch** (audit-a01–a12): tool use agentic loop, API enumeration, secrets scanning, cloud enumeration, IAM privilege escalation analysis, MCP integration, IaC review, SOC 2 evidence collection, multi-agent orchestration, risk report writing, sentinel scheduling, full pipeline
  - **Continuous Monitoring epoch** (audit-cm01–cm12): ISCM baseline, SIEM + ML anomaly detection, UEBA risk scoring, NDR beaconing detection, CSPM attack path mapping, STIX/TAXII threat intel, SOAR playbook automation, deception/honeytokens, Zero Trust CARTA scoring, XDR cross-source correlation, continuous compliance engine, SOC maturity scorecard

---

## v1.5.3 — 2026-05-18

**Back navigation + CTF terminal persistence**

- `BackLink.tsx` — all back buttons now call `router.back()` for consistent browser-history navigation
- `CtfChallenge` saves terminal state to localStorage on solve (`ctf-state:<stageId>`) and restores it on return — progress survives navigation away from a stage
- "↺ Replay" button resets saved CTF state so users can re-run challenges from scratch

---
