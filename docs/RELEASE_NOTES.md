# Kryptós CronOS — Release Notes

---

## v0.7.0 — Planned (Q3 2026)

**AI personalization layer + Cisco product integrations**

- Adaptive difficulty engine — adjusts challenge complexity based on command patterns and time-on-task
- **Cisco Talos integration** — weekly CVE challenge drops sourced from Talos threat intelligence feed
- **Cisco Umbrella epoch** — new curriculum track: DNS tunneling, DGA detection, network policy enforcement
- **Cisco SecureX / XDR track** — enterprise SecOps stages: alert triage, incident investigation, response workflows
- **Cisco Firepower stages** — network defense: firewall rule exploitation, lateral movement detection
- **Cisco CyberOps Associate alignment** — Cisco epoch badge completions map to CyberOps exam domains; exam voucher redemption flow
- **Cisco DevNet track** — API security and automation: REST exploitation, OAuth misconfigurations
- CI pipeline (GitHub Actions: lint + tsc + build + audit)
- Streaks and milestone badges

## v0.6.0 — 2026-05-11

**Security hardening sprint — all findings from security review resolved**

- **proxy.ts is the active middleware** — confirmed as the correct Next.js 16 filename (not middleware.ts); `ƒ Proxy (Middleware)` appears in build output
- **Internal docs gated** — moved from `public/docs/` to `secured-docs/`; served only via `/api/docs/[file]` requiring admin HMAC cookie; `outputFileTracingIncludes` added to next.config.ts for Vercel bundling
- **HSTS header** added: `max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload`
- **XP computed server-side** — `/api/progress` POST uses a hardcoded `STAGE_XP` map; client-submitted XP ignored
- **sync-user first-write-wins** — existing Redis user records cannot be overwritten
- **Rate limiting** — forgot-password (3/IP/15min), notify-registration (5/IP/hour) via Redis incr
- **admin-session** throws if `ADMIN_SECRET` env var is missing (no empty-string fallback)
- **reset-password** no longer returns email in response — returns only username
- Emerald accent theme added to Before Times epoch

## v0.5.0 — 2026-05-10

**Live leaderboard, cross-device sync, epoch gating, proxy migration**

- Live global leaderboard powered by Upstash Redis sorted set
- Server-side progress persistence: XP, completed stages, and badges synced to Redis on every stage completion
- Cross-device progress restore: logging in on a new device merges server progress with local state
- Cisco epoch now gated — locked until all 12 Foundations stages are completed
- `isEpochUnlocked()` computes epoch access dynamically from progress at render time
- Leaderboard page fetches live data from `/api/leaderboard`; falls back gracefully if offline
- `GET /api/progress` and `POST /api/progress` routes added for progress sync
- Migrated `middleware.ts` → `proxy.ts` (Next.js 16 convention)
- Deleted legacy `CtfTerminal.tsx` (superseded by `CtfChallenge.tsx` since v0.1.0)

---

## v0.4.1 — 2026-05-10

**Security hardening**

- Admin username removed from source code — moved to server-side env var (`ADMIN_USERNAME`)
- Admin cookie grant now server-side only via signed HMAC token (`ADMIN_SECRET`)
- New API route `/api/admin-session` handles admin cookie issuance and revocation
- Next.js proxy — `/admin/**` routes blocked at the edge without valid HttpOnly cookie
- `isAdmin()` reads from stored user record instead of hardcoded string
- Registration no longer auto-grants admin based on username match
- Admin notification email moved from hardcoded to `ADMIN_EMAIL` env var
- Content Security Policy header added
- Fixed hardcoded admin username display in admin dashboard UI

---

## v0.4.0 — 2026-05-10

**Curriculum tracks + Cisco ops rewrite**

- Foundations track: 12 core cybersecurity stages set in ancient world landmarks
- Cisco track: 12 real Cisco CVE stages framed as APT field operations
- All 12 Cisco CTF scenarios rewritten — spy/APT operative tone, real locations

---

## v0.3.0 — 2026-05-09

## v0.2.0 — 2026-05-09
