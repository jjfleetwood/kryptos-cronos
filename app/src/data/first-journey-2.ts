High latency (500ms+) makes apps feel sluggish and video calls choppy.",

Add processing time at each hop, queuing delays in congested routers, and TLS handshake round trips, and you quickly reach 300–400ms for a transatlantic connection.",

If someone tampers with those records — changing the venue from Steamer Lane to Capitola — every competitor shows up at the wrong location.

Cache poisoning attacks inject a fake DNS response into that cache — tricking the resolver into thinking that 'yourbank.com' points to the attacker's server. Every user relying on that resolver gets sent to a convincing fake site and their credentials are stolen.",
