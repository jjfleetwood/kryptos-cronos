        "The end-to-end agentic audit pipeline combines all components covered in this epoch: tool use for data collection, MCP servers for system integration, multi-agent orchestration for parallel workstreams, AI-powered analysis for IAM/secrets/IaC, automated evidence collection, report generation, and continuous monitoring for post-audit drift detection.",
        "A complete agentic audit engagement runs as follows: (1) Auditor defines scope (account IDs, regions, applicable standards), (2) Orchestrator agent plans workstreams and spawns specialists, (3) Specialists run in parallel — IAM, network, secrets, IaC, logging, (4) Orchestrator synthesizes cross-domain findings, (5) Report writer generates draft report, (6) Continuous sentinel is activated for ongoing monitoring, (7) Auditor reviews and finalizes in hours, not weeks.",
        "The agentic pipeline doesn't replace auditors — it eliminates the mechanical parts of auditing (data collection, formatting, basic pattern matching) so auditors can focus on judgment: assessing risk context, evaluating compensating controls, advising on remediation strategy, and communicating findings to stakeholders.",

          "Layer 1 — Data collection: MCP servers (filesystem, git, GitHub, fetch) + custom AWS/GCP/Azure SDK tools. Layer 2 — Analysis: specialized Claude agents per domain with domain-specific prompts and tool sets. Layer 3 — Orchestration: orchestrator agent with multi-agent coordination and cross-domain synthesis. Layer 4 — Output: report generation agent + evidence package builder. Layer 5 — Operations: scheduled sentinel with alerting integration.",
          "The pipeline is implemented as a DAG (directed acyclic graph): inventory enumeration must complete before IAM analysis (which needs the role list), but IAM, network, secrets, and IaC analyses can run in parallel.

        impact: "$100M+ operational losses; hotel systems, slot machines, digital keys offline for 10 days",
        body: [
          "The MGM breach began with a social engineering call to the IT helpdesk — a technique that no technical audit tool catches. But the subsequent lateral movement, privilege escalation, and deployment of ALPHV ransomware all exploited gaps that would have appeared in a comprehensive agentic audit: overly permissive IAM roles, insufficient network segmentation between IT and OT systems, and inadequate monitoring of privileged account activity.",
          "MGM's environment was too large and complex for manual auditors to assess comprehensively. An agentic pipeline running weekly would have maintained a current inventory of every privileged role, every network connection between business units, and every anomalous authentication event — giving defenders the context needed to detect and respond faster.",
