      overview: [
        "Intelligence agencies, quantum computing companies, and academic researchers provide widely varying estimates for when a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC) will exist: anywhere from 5 to 30 years. The Five Eyes intelligence community (US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand) has converged on a planning horizon of 2030-2035 for classified systems.",
        "The key insight for security planners is that it doesn't matter when exactly Q-Day arrives — what matters is whether your migration will be complete before it does. Enterprise cryptographic migrations take 3-7 years. NIST published the first PQC standards in August 2024. Organizations that start migration in 2024 can realistically complete by 2030-2031. Organizations that start in 2027 cannot.",
        "This final Quantum Foundations stage synthesizes the complete threat picture and provides the decision framework for beginning post-quantum migration. After this stage, Epoch 4b covers the specific post-quantum algorithms, and Epoch 4c covers QKD and enterprise migration execution.",

        title: "PQC Migration Decision Framework",
        body: [
          "The migration decision is driven by: (1) data sensitivity lifetime — how long does the data need to remain confidential? (2) HNDL exposure — is this data being transmitted over internet-facing infrastructure where adversaries can collect it today? (3) migration timeline — how long will it take to update this system?",
          "NIST's 2024 timeline recommendation: organizations should plan to migrate from quantum-vulnerable algorithms by 2030 (for high-sensitivity data) and complete all migrations by 2035. Given typical enterprise migration timelines, beginning in 2024-2025 is necessary to meet the 2030 target.",
