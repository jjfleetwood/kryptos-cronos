        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. When a victim's browser renders the page, the script executes in the context of the trusted website — bypassing the Same-Origin Policy and accessing cookies, session tokens, and page content.",
        "XSS comes in three flavors: Reflected (script in the URL, executed immediately), Stored (script saved in the database, executed for every visitor), and DOM-based (script manipulates the page's DOM without server involvement). Stored XSS is the most dangerous — a single payload can affect millions of users.",

        "WannaCry was a ransomware cryptoworm that tore across 150 countries on May 12, 2017, infecting over 200,000 systems in a single day. It exploited EternalBlue (CVE-2017-0144), a vulnerability in Windows' SMBv1 protocol originally developed by the NSA and stolen and leaked by a group called Shadow Brokers.",
        "Unlike traditional ransomware that requires a user to click something, WannaCry spread autonomously across networks by scanning for vulnerable SMBv1 servers on port 445. Once on a system, it encrypted files and demanded $300–600 in Bitcoin. The self-spreading 'worm' capability turned a ransomware attack into a global catastrophe.",
        "The attack was eventually slowed when security researcher Marcus Hutchins accidentally discovered a kill switch: WannaCry checked whether a long, nonsensical domain name was registered before executing. By registering the domain for $10.69, Hutchins triggered the kill switch and stopped new infections globally.",

It is considered one of the most severe data breaches in history due to the sensitivity of the data exposed.",
        "The root cause was a known, patched vulnerability (CVE-2017-5638) in Apache Struts 2, a popular Java web framework. Apache released a patch in March 2017. Equifax was notified by US-CERT the same day. Equifax did not apply the patch. Two months and eight days later, attackers began exploiting the vulnerability — going undetected for 78 days.",
