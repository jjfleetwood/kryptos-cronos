Instead of 'retrieve the scroll on astronomy for Scribe Euclid', they inscribe 'retrieve the scroll on astronomy OR return all scrolls in the restricted vault'. The keeper, following the inscription literally, returns everything — including the Pharaoh's most secret records.",

      year: 2016,
      overview: [
        "The Tower of London held the Crown Jewels — but also the NSA's most prized intelligence on medieval Britain. Its messengers used a standard signaling protocol (SNMP — the Standard Network Message Protocol of its day) that any authorized observer could read. French spies discovered that sending an oversized message in that protocol format caused the Tower's message handler to overflow its parchment buffer, writing into adjacent memory — and executing the spy's instructions.",
        "CVE-2016-6366 (EXTRABACON) is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the SNMP subsystem of Cisco ASA (Adaptive Security Appliance) firewalls. Developed by the NSA's Equation Group as an offensive cyberweapon, EXTRABACON was leaked by the Shadow Brokers on August 13, 2016 — the same data dump that exposed EternalBlue.",
        "The attack requires a valid SNMP community string (essentially a read-only password for network monitoring) — which organizations frequently leave at default values like 'public' or 'private'. With the community string, an attacker can send a crafted SNMP packet that overflows a heap buffer in the ASA's SNMP handler and achieves unauthenticated remote code execution.",

        body: [
          "SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is used for network device monitoring. ASA firewalls expose an SNMP agent that accepts queries using a community string for authentication. The vulnerability lies in the way the ASA's SNMP code processes certain OID (Object Identifier) requests — it copies attacker-supplied data into a fixed-size heap buffer without checking the length.",
          "EXTRABACON was specifically developed for Cisco ASA 5500, 5500-X series, PIX firewalls, and other Cisco products. The attack shellcode was adapted for each specific ASA firmware version. The Shadow Brokers leak included prebuilt payloads for dozens of ASA versions.",

# Step 2: Run EXTRABACON with leaked NSA tool

# What happens internally:
# 1. Crafted SNMP packet sent to UDP/161
# 2. SNMP OID triggers vulnerable code path
# 3. Heap buffer overflow overwrites adjacent memory
# 4. Control flow hijacked to attacker shellcode
# 5. Authentication bypass patched into ASA firmware
