        "Its scope is larger than most organizations realize:\n- Cryptography lives not just in explicit security tools (PKI, VPNs, email encryption) but in every TLS connection, SSH session, JWT, encryption-at-rest layer, API auth, and code-signing pipeline.\n- HSMs, IoT firmware, embedded controllers, and legacy SCADA all carry crypto dependencies often invisible to IT.",
        "Without a CBOM, you can't assess risk, prioritize, or report readiness:\n- CISA's 2023 roadmap requires federal agencies to complete cryptographic inventories by 2025, and NIST IR 8547 provides the CBOM field taxonomy.\n- Tools like Cryptosense Analyzer, XAEGIS, and IBM Quantum Safe Explorer automate CBOM generation from network traffic and source-code analysis.",

        "Each standard replaces a specific classical primitive:\n- ML-KEM (from CRYSTALS-Kyber) replaces RSA/ECDH for key exchange in TLS, SSH, VPNs, and any key-agreement protocol.\n- ML-DSA (from CRYSTALS-Dilithium) replaces RSA/ECDSA for signatures — code signing, certificates, JWT, document signing; SLH-DSA (from SPHINCS+) offers a hash-based alternative for algorithm diversity.",
        "Most organizations should make FIPS 203 and 204 their primary algorithms:\n- These are what CISA, NSA, and international bodies (ETSI, ISO) endorse, with SLH-DSA as backup diversity if lattice cryptography is later weakened.\n- All three rest on problems believed hard for both classical and quantum computers.",

        "Prioritization is risk-based:\n- Long-secrecy-horizon data (classified, healthcare, legal) migrates first because it's already at HNDL risk; internet-facing RSA/ECC key exchange is next, being exposed to bulk collection.\n- Internal and legacy/air-gapped systems migrate later — and CISA stresses 'crypto agility': build systems so algorithms can be updated without full redesign.",
        "Common migration blockers are predictable:\n- PKI dependencies (leaf certs can't migrate before root CAs), and hardware-constrained systems (IoT, embedded, SCADA) lacking compute for lattice algorithms.\n- Legacy protocols with hardcoded algorithm negotiation, and third-party software with no PQC roadmap — so CISA recommends a vendor-engagement program to formally query every vendor for PQC support timelines.",

          "Crypto agility runs through an abstraction layer:\n- Separate algorithm selection from application logic — OpenSSL 3.x providers, Java JCA providers, and Go crypto/x509 all swap algorithms without app changes.\n- Tag every cryptographic operation with algorithm identifiers in logs for future audit, and avoid hardcoding algorithm OIDs or key sizes in application code.",

        "Hybrid mode is a 5–10 year bridge, not permanent:\n- Once NIST PQC algorithms have 5+ years of real-world cryptanalysis without weakness, organizations should move to pure PQC.\n- It also carries overhead: TLS handshakes grow from ~2KB to ~4KB, so load balancers and CDNs must handle larger handshakes without MTU fragmentation.",

      year: 2024,
      overview: [
        "Quantum-safe architecture requires more than algorithm substitution — it requires designing systems with cryptographic agility as a first-class property. Cryptographic agility means that an organization can update the cryptographic algorithms in use across its systems without redesigning the systems themselves. This requires abstract cryptographic interfaces rather than hardcoded algorithm implementations, centralized key management infrastructure that supports multiple algorithm types simultaneously, and certificate issuance pipelines that can mint certificates using any supported algorithm on demand.",
        "NIST SP 800-218 (Secure Software Development Framework) and NIST SP 800-57 Part 2 (Key Management Guidelines) both emphasize crypto agility as a design requirement. The architectural components that enable agility: a cryptographic service abstraction layer (CSAL) that translates algorithm-agnostic requests into specific algorithm calls; a key management system (KMS) that stores keys tagged with algorithm metadata and supports rotation; a certificate authority that issues certificates in multiple algorithm formats (RSA, ML-DSA, composite).",
        "Quantum-safe architecture also requires addressing long-lived keys. TLS session keys are ephemeral — they are generated per-session and discarded, so migrating to PQC protects future sessions immediately. But long-lived keys — CA root keys, HSM master keys, SSH host keys, code signing keys — may need to remain valid for years or decades. These must be migrated first, because a CA root key compromise allows forging all certificates it has signed, past and future.",

      overview: [
        "Third-party and supply chain quantum risk is one of the least-addressed aspects of post-quantum migration. An organization's own cryptographic systems may be migrated to PQC, but if the organization exchanges sensitive data with suppliers using RSA-encrypted channels, those data exchanges are still HNDL-vulnerable. B2B integrations using SOAP, REST, EDI, or SFTP often use RSA-2048 TLS and have no PQC roadmap because they are maintained by external vendors who have not been asked to provide one. CISA's supply chain guidance explicitly includes cryptographic dependency assessment as part of third-party risk management.",
        "The CISA ICT Supply Chain Risk Management Task Force has recommended that organizations extend their CBOM programs to include third-party connections: inventory all API integrations, SFTP feeds, B2B VPN tunnels, and EDI exchanges, and document the cryptographic algorithms each uses. Vendor PQC questionnaires should ask: (1) Has the vendor completed a cryptographic inventory? (2) Does the vendor have a NIST PQC migration roadmap? (3) What is the vendor's target migration completion date? (4) Does the vendor support hybrid TLS? (5) What is the vendor's SLA for cryptographic algorithm updates?",
        "Hardware supply chain quantum risk includes cryptographic hardware — HSMs, smart cards, TPM chips, TLS accelerators — that have algorithm assumptions baked into silicon. A TPM 2.0 chip manufactured before 2024 likely supports RSA and ECC but not ML-KEM or ML-DSA — the chip cannot be firmware-upgraded to add these algorithms. Organizations must incorporate PQC algorithm support requirements into hardware procurement specifications, and must plan for hardware replacement rather than firmware update for silicon-level quantum migration.",
