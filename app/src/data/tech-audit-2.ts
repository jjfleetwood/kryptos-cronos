        "Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) — ranked #1 in the OWASP API Security Top 10 — occurs when an API endpoint uses a user-supplied identifier to retrieve objects without verifying the requesting user has permission to access that specific object. The attacker simply changes the ID in the request.",
        "API security audits differ from web application audits because APIs are often designed with the assumption that only authorized clients will call them. But APIs are discoverable, and the parameters they accept are predictable. A payment API that accepts /api/v1/payments/{payment_id} will return any payment if BOLA exists — not just the caller's payments.",
        "OWASP API Top 10 (2023) covers: BOLA, Broken Authentication, Broken Object Property Level Authorization, Unrestricted Resource Consumption, Broken Function Level Authorization, Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows, Server-Side Request Forgery, Security Misconfiguration, Improper Inventory Management, and Unsafe Consumption of APIs.",

          "Automated testing: Use tools like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, or Postman. For each API endpoint that accepts an object identifier, fuzz the identifier with sequential IDs, UUIDs from other test accounts, and negative/zero values. Monitor responses for unexpected data disclosure.",
