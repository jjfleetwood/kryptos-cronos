      overview: [
        "SLH-DSA (Stateless Hash-based Digital Signature Algorithm), standardized as NIST FIPS 205 in August 2024, is based on SPHINCS+ and has the most conservative security assumptions of all PQC signature schemes. Its security relies solely on the collision resistance and second-preimage resistance of the underlying hash function (SHA-256 or SHAKE-256) — not on any algebraic hardness assumption.",
        "This makes SLH-DSA uniquely trustworthy: if SHA-256 is not broken, SLH-DSA is secure. Even if lattice problems turn out to be easier than expected, SLH-DSA remains secure. For root CAs, firmware signing, and other long-lived high-security applications where maximum conservatism is warranted, SLH-DSA is the recommended choice.",
        "The tradeoff: SLH-DSA signatures are large (7856-49856 bytes depending on parameter set) and signing is slow (milliseconds to seconds for some parameter sets). For applications where signature size or speed is critical, ML-DSA is preferred. For root-of-trust signing (done infrequently, permanent consequences), SLH-DSA's conservative security justifies the overhead.",

The hypertree provides statefulness-free operation: the signer chooses a random leaf for each signature, so no state tracking is needed (unlike classic stateful hash-based signatures like XMSS).",
          "Security proof: breaking SLH-DSA requires either finding a collision in the hash function or solving a second-preimage problem — both are hard even for quantum computers (Grover's gives only O(√N) speedup, doubled by using SHA-256/512 with adequate output size).",

FALCON-512 produces 666-byte signatures (vs 3293 for ML-DSA-65) and FALCON-1024 produces 1280-byte signatures — closer to RSA in size.",
        "FALCON is based on the NTRU lattice problem and uses the Fast Fourier Transform for efficient Gaussian sampling in polynomial rings. This Gaussian sampling is what enables the compact signatures — but it also makes FALCON significantly harder to implement correctly than ML-DSA.",
        "FALCON's complexity is its main limitation: side-channel attacks against FALCON implementations are a genuine concern. Constant-time Gaussian sampling is notoriously difficult to implement. For most deployments, ML-DSA is preferred for its implementation simplicity. FALCON is recommended for size-constrained environments like IoT devices, embedded systems, and bandwidth-limited protocols.",

Signing involves sampling a short vector from a Gaussian distribution over this lattice — using the short basis as the trapdoor. The Fast Fourier Transform makes this sampling efficient.",
          "The critical security property is that the Gaussian sampling must be perfectly discrete — any deviation (due to floating-point rounding, timing variations, or distribution skew) can leak the private key. This is why FALCON requires careful, validated implementations. Open Quantum Safe (liboqs) provides a reference implementation that addresses these concerns.",

      overview: [
        "Post-quantum cryptographic algorithms are more complex than RSA and ECDSA. Implementation mistakes — improper rejection sampling, non-constant-time operations, incorrect parameter validation — can completely undermine the quantum security guarantees. Multiple PQC implementation vulnerabilities have been discovered since the NIST competition began.",
        "NIST, ACVTS (Automated Cryptographic Validation Testing System), and FIPS 140-3 testing labs provide validation programs for PQC implementations. Organizations must use FIPS 140-3 validated modules for federal systems — and should prefer validated implementations for all high-security applications.",
        "Key testing areas: (1) Known-answer tests (KAT) — verify algorithm produces correct output for known inputs; (2) Interoperability testing — verify cross-library compatibility; (3) Side-channel testing — verify constant-time operation; (4) Fault injection — verify behavior under hardware faults.",

          "Side-channel validation is particularly important for ML-KEM and FALCON. Timing side-channels occur when the execution time of a cryptographic operation depends on secret data.
