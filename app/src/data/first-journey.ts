At the city limits there's a checkpoint: commercial trucks take the Highway 17 bypass, tourists go through downtown, and unauthorized vehicles get turned around. A firewall works identically: it inspects each packet's source IP, destination IP, port, and protocol, then applies a ruleset — allow or deny.",

Every packet attempting to cross the boundary is evaluated against the rules in order. The first rule that matches wins. Most firewalls end with a default-deny rule: anything not explicitly permitted is blocked.",

For example: 192.168.1.0/24 means the first 24 bits are the network (192.168.1) and the last 8 bits identify devices (0–255). This subnet holds up to 254 devices.",
