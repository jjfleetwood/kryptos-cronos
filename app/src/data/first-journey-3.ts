The goal is to steal credentials, install malware, or trick you into wire-transferring money.",

Because they share the secret and time is synchronized, they get the same 6-digit code — without any communication.",

        "The tackle shop's bait locker uses a combination lock. A 3-digit lock (000–999) can be cracked by trying all 1,000 combinations in minutes. A 6-digit lock takes 1,000x longer. An 8-digit lock: 100,000x longer. Password strength works by the same math: more characters = exponentially more combinations = exponentially more time to crack.",
        "A password's strength comes from entropy — the number of bits required to represent it as information. A random 8-character password using lowercase only has 26^8 ≈ 200 billion combinations. Add uppercase (52^8) and numbers (62^8) — 218 trillion combinations. Add length to 16 characters: 62^16 ≈ 47 sextillion. Modern password crackers run at 100 billion guesses per second on GPU hardware.",

Dictionary attacks try common words and patterns first; brute force tries all combinations of a given character set and length.",
          "Salting: a random salt is added to each password before hashing, so two users with the same password have different hashes. This prevents rainbow table attacks (precomputed hash lookups) and forces the attacker to crack each hash individually. bcrypt, scrypt, and Argon2 are designed to be deliberately slow, making large-scale cracking impractical.",
