        "Impact (TA0040) is the final tactic — the attacker's objective is achieved. Impact techniques include: T1486 — Data Encrypted for Impact (ransomware), T1485 — Data Destruction (wiper malware), T1491 — Defacement, T1498 — Network Denial of Service, T1529 — System Shutdown/Reboot (to trigger damage at scale).",
        "Ransomware (T1486) has become the dominant impact technique because it monetizes access directly. Modern ransomware operations are multi-stage: pre-ransomware reconnaissance and data exfiltration (for double extortion), deployment of the encryptor across all accessible systems simultaneously, and ransom note delivery.",
        "Supply chain ransomware (T1195.002) amplifies impact by targeting managed service providers (MSPs) — a single compromised MSP can propagate ransomware to hundreds of customer organizations simultaneously. Kaseya VSA demonstrated this at scale: one compromised RMM platform, 1,500 downstream victims.",

          "Pre-encryption detection: ransomware operators typically exfiltrate data (for double extortion) before encrypting. Large outbound transfers are detectable. The encryption process itself is detectable: high-volume file modification events (Event ID 4663 — file write), file extension changes (.docx → .locked), shadow copy deletion (vssadmin delete shadows /all).",
          "Backup and recovery: the single most effective ransomware defense is immutable backups — backups the ransomware cannot reach or delete. 3-2-1 rule: 3 copies, 2 media types, 1 offsite. Air-gapped or cloud-immutable backups (Azure Blob Storage immutability, AWS S3 Object Lock) survive ransomware because they are inaccessible from the compromised network.",

          "The attack was timed for July 4th weekend when IT staff would be minimal. The ransomware encrypted all files simultaneously across thousands of organizations within hours. Sweden's Coop grocery chain closed 800 stores because their point-of-sale systems ran on a Kaseya-managed MSP.
