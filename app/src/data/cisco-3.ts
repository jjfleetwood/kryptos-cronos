      year: 2024,
      overview: [
        "Threat hunting is the proactive discipline of searching for attacker activity that has evaded automated detection. Unlike reactive incident response triggered by SIEM alerts, threat hunters form hypotheses based on threat intelligence, adversary TTPs from MITRE ATT&CK, and anomalies in telemetry — then actively query logs, endpoint data, and network captures to confirm or refute them.",
        "Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are forensic artifacts that suggest a system has been compromised: malicious IP addresses, file hashes of known malware, suspicious registry keys, anomalous DNS queries, and unusual outbound connections. IOCs are curated in threat intelligence platforms like Cisco SecureX Threat Intelligence, MISP, and VirusTotal.",
        "Cisco CyberOps Associate covers hunt methodology: building hypotheses from ATT&CK TTPs, querying endpoint telemetry, identifying lateral movement in authentication logs, and detecting C2 beaconing through DNS and NetFlow analysis.",

        body: [
          "A threat hunt begins with a hypothesis: 'Assume an attacker gained a foothold via phishing. What evidence would they leave in DNS queries, process execution logs, and network flows?' The hunter queries data sources to confirm or refute that hypothesis.",
          "Command-and-Control (C2) beaconing is a high-value hunt target. Malware checks in with a C2 server at regular intervals using HTTP/HTTPS or DNS. Beaconing leaves distinctive patterns: regular connection intervals (e.g., every 60 seconds), connections to recently registered domains, or DNS queries with high-entropy names from DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm) malware.",
          "Lateral movement produces authentication artifacts: pass-the-hash shows as NTLM authentication to multiple hosts in a short window; pass-the-ticket appears as Kerberos TGS requests for service accounts; RDP lateral movement shows as Event ID 4624 (logon type 10) on destination hosts.",
