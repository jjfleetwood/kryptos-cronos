      overview: [
        "In February 2016, Cisco disclosed CVE-2016-1287 — a heap buffer overflow in the IKEv1 and IKEv2 UDP fragmentation code of the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA). The vulnerability required no authentication: an attacker on the internet could send a crafted UDP packet to port 500 or 4500, trigger a heap overflow, and execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the firewall.",
        "The ASA is Cisco's flagship enterprise firewall product, deployed at the perimeter of millions of networks. Compromising the perimeter firewall gives an attacker a vantage point inside the network with no further exploitation needed — all traffic, all VPN sessions, all connected systems become visible.",
        "With a CVSS score of 10.0, this vulnerability represented the worst possible severity. Cisco released an emergency patch and urged immediate action. The Shadow Brokers, who later leaked NSA hacking tools, had a working exploit for this vulnerability in their arsenal.",

          "On 32-bit ASA platforms, this overflow was directly exploitable for remote code execution. On 64-bit platforms it typically caused a device reload (denial of service). Both UDP/500 (IKE) and UDP/4500 (NAT-T) were affected. No authentication was required at any stage.",

The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial of service (reload) of Cisco ASA and FTD devices by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the management or data plane interface.",
        "ArcaneDoor targeted government networks worldwide in a campaign discovered by Cisco Talos in early 2024. The attackers used CVE-2024-20353 to crash firewalls — likely to disrupt logging and detection — and CVE-2024-20359 to install a persistent backdoor. Together, the two CVEs formed a complete attack chain against the most widely deployed enterprise firewalls.",

          "Cisco disclosed CVE-2018-0296 in June 2018. The simplicity of the exploit — a single HTTP GET request — meant that within days of disclosure, automated scanners were probing the internet for vulnerable ASA devices. Organizations that hadn't patched experienced unexpected firewall reloads that initially appeared to be hardware failures.",
          "The vulnerability was widely exploited in the days following disclosure. Multiple organizations reported unexplained ASA crashes that were later attributed to CVE-2018-0296 exploitation. The directory listing capability was used by attackers to map ASA configurations before launching more sophisticated attacks.",
