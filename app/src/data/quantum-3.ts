        "In 1984, Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard published BB84 — the world's first quantum key distribution protocol. Unlike mathematical cryptography, BB84's security is guaranteed by physics: the no-cloning theorem ensures that any attempt to copy a quantum state disturbs it, making eavesdroppers detectable by the laws of nature.",
        "BB84 uses photon polarization as qubits, transmitted over a quantum channel (fiber or free-space optical). Alice sends photons polarized in random bases; Bob measures in random bases. After transmission, they publicly compare which bases they used (not the bits), and keep only the bits where they used the same basis — the sifted key.",
        "The quantum bit error rate (QBER) is the key security metric. A clean channel has QBER below 5%. If an eavesdropper (Eve) measures and retransmits photons (intercept-resend attack), she introduces ~25% errors — making her presence statistically detectable. If QBER exceeds 11%, the key exchange is aborted.",

After measurement, publicly revealed bases determine the sifted key — bits where bases matched. Privacy amplification then shortens the key to remove any partial information an eavesdropper might have.",
          "QBER calculation: sample a subset of the sifted key publicly, count disagreements. QBER = errors/sample_size. For an intercept-resend attack, Eve randomly guesses 50% of bases correctly, and re-sends in wrong basis 50% of the time — introducing 25% QBER. Classical noise typically contributes 1-5% QBER.

Nation-state adversaries are recording TLS traffic today, waiting for the quantum computer that will decrypt it. The cryptographic transition to post-quantum algorithms is the largest infrastructure migration in the history of computing.",

Every layer must be addressed; a failure at any layer undermines the security of the layers above it.",
        "The good news: the tools exist. FIPS 203/204/205 are published. Validated libraries (AWS-LC, SymCrypt) are available. Production deployments (Chrome, Mullvad, Signal, Apple PQ3) prove viability.
