        "BB84 encodes bits in photon polarization over a quantum channel:\n- Alice sends photons polarized in random bases; Bob measures in random bases (fiber or free-space optical).\n- They publicly compare which bases they used — not the bits — and keep only the bits where the bases matched: the sifted key.",
        "The quantum bit error rate (QBER) is the security metric:\n- A clean channel runs below 5% QBER.\n- An eavesdropper doing intercept-resend injects ~25% errors, making her statistically detectable; above 11% QBER, the exchange is aborted.",

          "QBER both detects Eve and bounds her knowledge:\n- Sample a subset of the sifted key publicly and count disagreements: QBER = errors/sample.\n- Intercept-resend guesses the basis right 50% of the time, injecting ~25% QBER; classical noise adds 1–5%, so the 11% threshold clears noise while still catching Eve.",

      overview: [
        "The quantum migration is the most complex cryptographic program most enterprises have ever undertaken. It requires board-level support, sustained multi-year budget, cross-functional coordination (security, infrastructure, development, procurement), and vendor management. Most CISOs are still explaining what quantum computers are to their boards.",
        "Effective quantum governance starts with risk quantification: translate the technical threat (HNDL, Shor's algorithm, Q-Day timeline) into financial terms that boards understand — potential data breach costs, regulatory fines, competitive intelligence exposure. Then build a phased program: discovery → foundation → core systems → complete → sustain.",
        "The business case for PQC investment is straightforward: the cost of migration (typically 0.5-2% of annual IT budget over 5 years) is far less than the expected loss from a post-Q-Day breach of records collected today. Regulatory pressure (FFIEC, OMB, future SEC requirements) provides additional urgency that resonates with audit committees.",

        { id: "quantum-c10-q3", type: "Architecture", challenge: "Layer 1 output.", text: "In the 10-layer quantum-safe stack, what does L1 (Crypto Inventory) produce?", options: ["A CBOM generated via tools like Syft and CycloneDX","An AES key","A QKD link","A board memo only"], correctIndex: 0, explanation: "Layer 1 yields the Cryptography Bill of Materials, the data foundation for everything above it." },

        { id: "quantum-c10-q5", type: "Pitfall", challenge: "Residual archive risk.", text: "Are RSA/ECC-encrypted archives created before migration protected once a quantum-safe TLS layer is deployed at the perimeter?", options: ["No — pre-migration archives remain residual HNDL risk and must be re-encrypted with PQC key transport","Yes, the perimeter covers them","Yes, TLS retroactively secures stored data","Only if QBER is low"], correctIndex: 0, explanation: "Perimeter TLS protects new traffic, not already-stored ciphertext; old archives need re-encryption." },
        { id: "quantum-c10-q6", type: "Architecture", challenge: "Stack purpose.", text: "What is the purpose of organizing quantum-safe controls into a layered stack?", options: ["To sequence inventory, prioritization, hybrid crypto, and agility into a coherent migration program","To replace TLS with QKD","To avoid using a CBOM","To increase key reuse"], correctIndex: 0, explanation: "The layered model turns scattered tasks into an ordered, auditable transition program." },
        { id: "quantum-c10-q7", type: "Strategy", challenge: "Why data-in-transit first.", text: "Why does high-sensitivity data in transit top the migration order?", options: ["It is actively harvestable now and often has long secrecy requirements","It is the easiest to change","It uses the smallest keys","It is exempt from HNDL"], correctIndex: 0, explanation: "In-transit secrets are exposed to harvesting today and frequently must stay secret for years." },
