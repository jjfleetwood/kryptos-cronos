This includes all information accessible through this demo.

2. NON-DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS
Recipient agrees to: (a) hold all Confidential Information in strict confidence; (b) not disclose Confidential Information to any third party without prior written consent; (c) use Confidential Information solely to evaluate the platform for the purpose for which access was granted; (d) protect Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care used to protect Recipient's own confidential information, but no less than reasonable care.

5. TERM
This Agreement remains in effect for two (2) years from the date of acceptance, and obligations with respect to trade secrets continue indefinitely.

6. RETURN OF INFORMATION
Upon request, Recipient will promptly return or destroy all Confidential Information and certify such destruction in writing.

7. REMEDIES
Recipient acknowledges that breach of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm for which monetary damages would be inadequate, and that the Company is entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction, in addition to all other remedies.

8. GOVERNING LAW
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes shall be resolved in the courts of Delaware.
