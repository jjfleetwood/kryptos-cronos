# CyberQuest Release Notes

---

## v0.4.0 — 2026-05-10

**Curriculum tracks + Cisco ops rewrite**

- Replaced "epoch" system with named curriculum tracks: **Foundations** and **Cisco**
- Foundations track (amber): 12 core cybersecurity principle stages set in ancient world landmarks
- Cisco track (blue): 12 real Cisco CVE stages framed as APT field operations
- All 12 Cisco CTF scenarios rewritten — spy/APT operative tone, grounded in location, no fantasy framing
- Cisco tab color updated to Cisco blue
- Each Cisco CTF drops the player mid-mission; most stages start with direct action (no file-read opener)
- Wonders retained as operation locations (Hagia Sophia → Istanbul, Tower of London → London, etc.)

**Commits:** `07a5b5b`
