## Notes

- Hours are estimated based on scope of changes (files modified, complexity, research involved)
- AI-assisted sessions compress 3–5× vs. solo development — logged hours reflect equivalent human-developer effort
- "Equivalent developer cost" is the market value of the work produced, not actual spend
- AI cost is the amortized Claude Max subscription cost per session (not per-token billing)
- Update the Summary block after each deploy session
