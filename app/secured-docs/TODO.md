# Kryptós CronOS — To-Do & Roadmap

**Last updated:** 2026-05-28 (v1.16.0-pre)

---

## New Items — Added 2026-05-28

| # | Item | Effort | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | **Elementary section redesign (5-10 yr perspective)** | 3-5 days | P2 | The "Our First Journey" (bt-01–bt-30) content is too advanced for 5-10 year olds. Redesign quiz/CTF content, language, and examples with age-appropriate framing. Think Duolingo Kids / PBS Kids security awareness. Current content should be moved to a "Foundations" level. |
| B | **Incentive system to drive stage completion** | 2-3 days | P2 | Ideas: sponsor prizes (AWS/CrowdStrike swag), free certificate training vouchers, free Pro month (requires completing a detailed survey), streak-based rewards, leaderboard prizes for top-10, shareable completion badges (LinkedIn-optimized), milestone certificates (25/50/100 stages). Coordinate with sponsor outreach in P4. |
| C | **Certificate paths (Cisco CyberOps / CompTIA / ISC²)** | 5-7 days | P2 | Full guided paths per cert: prerequisite map using Kryptós CronOS content, per-domain stage-to-exam mapping, study plan with multiple options (self-study, bootcamp, Udemy), exam registration links (Pearson VUE / Prometric), cost breakdown, passing score info, job listings from Indeed/LinkedIn that the certification unlocks. Start with CyberOps Associate (50+ Cisco stages already mapped at /cyberops). |
| D | **Resume building module** | 3-5 days | P3 | Interactive module: guided questions about experience + skills + goals → generates a security-focused resume template. Stage completions auto-populate skill bullets (e.g., "Exploited CVE-2023-20198 in simulated lab environment"). Export as PDF or copy-paste text. Link to real job listings by role. |
| E | **Images for all stage briefing pages** | 5-7 days | P2 | Paris (stages 9-20) and Milan (stages 9-20) done with Wikimedia Commons images. Need: security stages (abstract/cyberpunk), baseball stages, driving stages, hair/nail stages, quantum stages. Use CC0 / Unsplash / Wikimedia Commons. Validate license for each image before adding. |
| F | **Update docs to v1.15.1 facts** | 1 day | P1 | BUSINESS_PROPOSAL_PRO.md, BUSINESS_PROPOSAL_CASUAL.md, PITCH_TARGETS.md, VC_READINESS_ANALYSIS.md, FINANCIALS.md all contain stale stage counts, prices, and feature descriptions. Update to: 438 stages, 36 epochs, 10 tracks, $13.99/mo or $99/yr, Supabase Auth, CyberOps tracker, adaptive difficulty. (Documentation review spawned as background task 2026-05-28.) |

## Priority 1 — Before Production Scale

| # | Item | Effort | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Production auth migration** | — | ✅ Done | PBKDF2 + HMAC-signed HttpOnly `session_token` cookie (30d). SessionStorage only caches username for UI rendering — no credentials client-side. Current posture is production-ready. Supabase migration deferred until OAuth or email-verification features are needed. |
| 2 | **Signed JWT / server-side sessions** | — | ✅ Done | `server-session.ts` issues HMAC-signed `u:{username}:{hmac}` tokens verified server-side on every request. Functionally equivalent to signed JWT. |
| 3 | **Server-side flag validation** | — | ✅ Done | `stage-flags.ts` has `import "server-only"` — cannot be bundled to client. `/api/check-flag` reads flags exclusively from this file. |
| 4 | **CI pipeline** | — | ✅ Done | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — lint + tsc + build + `npm audit --audit-level=high` on every push to master. |
| 5 | **Redis backup** | — | ✅ Done | Daily backups enabled in Upstash console. |

## Priority 2 — Curriculum Gaps

All documented Cisco curriculum gaps have been addressed in `cisco-advanced` epoch (v1.8.0).

| # | Item | Effort | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | **Cisco Firepower / FTD stages** | 2–3 days | ✅ Done | m39 (NGIPS fragmentation evasion CTF), m40 (FMC architecture quiz), m41 (CVE-2022-20927 SSL VPN DoS CTF) |
| 7 | **Cisco SecureX / XDR stages** | 1–2 days | ✅ Done | m42 (XDR threat hunt CTF), m43 (XDR architecture quiz), m44 (DNA Center API CTF) |
| 8 | **Cisco DevNet stages** | 1–2 days | ✅ Done | m45 (NETCONF/YANG/gRPC quiz), m46 (CyberOps kill chain CTF) |
| 9 | **CyberOps Associate stages** | 2 days | ✅ Done | m47 (CBROPS 200-201 domains quiz), m46 (SOC kill chain CTF) |
| — | **Cisco Silicon One & Quantum-Safe** | — | ✅ Done | m48 (Silicon One MACsec/gRPC telemetry CTF), m49 (P4 programmability quiz), m50 (IKEv2 hybrid PQC / ML-KEM-768 CTF) |

## Priority 3 — Product & UX

| # | Item | Effort | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10 | **Stage count audit** | — | ✅ Done | Fixed 338 → 346 across homepage (hero, stats, CTA, pricing); per-track numbers updated; "Nine tracks" → "Ten tracks"; stages/page.tsx description updated. |
| 11 | **Pro tier gating** | 3–5 days | ✅ Done | `tier` field on user Redis hash. `src/lib/access.ts` (server-only) gates all non-free stages. Free: bt-01/02/03. `ProPaywall` component with Stripe Checkout (monthly $5.99 / yearly $55.99). Webhook handler for `checkout.session.completed` + `customer.subscription.deleted`. Requires env vars: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `STRIPE_PRO_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID`, `STRIPE_PRO_YEARLY_PRICE_ID`. |
| 12 | **Hints monetization** | 2–3 days | Deferred | Tied to Stripe (#11 done). Ready to implement. |
| 13 | **User progress export** | — | ✅ Done | `GET /api/progress/certificate` generates PDF via @react-pdf/renderer: username, coins, stages, badges, streak, per-epoch breakdown. "Download Progress Report" button on Leaderboard page (logged-in users only). |
| 14 | **Mobile responsiveness audit** | — | ✅ Done | Leaderboard table: responsive grid (3-col mobile, 6-col sm+), secondary stats shown inline on mobile; FeedbackWidget: added `touch-action: none` on drag handle; CTF terminal: confirmed 100dvh, scrollIntoView on focus, sm: breakpoints. Stage map: confirmed 1→2→3 col grid. |

## Priority 4 — Business & Go-To-Market

| # | Item | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 15 | **Investor outreach — Tier 1** | ForgePoint Capital, SYN Ventures, ClearSky Security, Owl Ventures, Reach Capital, Cisco Investments. See `PITCH_TARGETS.md` (updated: 358 stages, 32 epochs, 10 tracks). |
| 16 | **Sponsor integration conversations** | CrowdStrike, AWS, SentinelOne, CompTIA, ISC². Contextual ad/sponsorship model aligned to stage topic. |
| 17 | **B2B enterprise motion** | $8/seat/mo targeting internal audit teams, SOC training programs, university cybersecurity programs. CAE advisory doc (`PITCH_CAE_CONTINUOUS_MONITORING.md`) is the lead asset. `BUSINESS_PROPOSAL_PRO.md` and `BUSINESS_PROPOSAL_CASUAL.md` updated to v1.8.0 stats. |
| 18 | ~~**kryptoscronos.com marketing site**~~ | ✅ Done — kryptoscronos.com IS the app. `src/app/page.tsx` updated to 358 stages, 32 epochs, 10 tracks. |

## Known Tech Debt

| # | Item | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 19 | ~~**`sync-user` route**~~ | ✅ Audited — route deleted, no client code references it. Stale `.next` cache was the only source of the phantom type error. |
| 20 | ~~**`unsafe-inline` CSP**~~ | ✅ Fixed — `src/proxy.ts` generates per-request nonce, sets dynamic `Content-Security-Policy` header with `nonce-{nonce}` in script-src. `next.config.ts` no longer sets static CSP. `layout.tsx` made async; reads `x-nonce` from request headers and applies to anti-FOUC script tag. (Next.js 16 Turbopack uses `proxy.ts` with `proxy` export, not `middleware.ts`.) |
| 21 | ~~**`any` cast in DocsViewer**~~ | ✅ Fixed — made `children` optional in all component prop types to match react-markdown's `Components` type. `as any` removed; tsc clean. |
