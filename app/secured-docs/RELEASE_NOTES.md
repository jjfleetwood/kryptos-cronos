**Adaptive difficulty engine — XP bonus, skill tracking, smart hints, recommended next**

- **`src/lib/difficulty.ts`** — new server-only engine: `computeStageScore` (time + hints + attempts → 0–100), `computeBonusXp` (+20% at score ≥ 80), `adaptiveCooldownSeconds` (Pro ARIA: 0s/15s/30s by skill), `getRecommendedNext` (harder or easier incomplete stage by skill), Redis helpers for rolling skill level and per-stage signal counters (`diff:<user>:level`, `diff:<user>:history`, `diff:<user>:hints:<stageId>`, `diff:<user>:attempts:<stageId>`)

## v0.5.0 — 2026-05-10

**Live leaderboard, cross-device sync, epoch gating, proxy migration**

- Live global leaderboard powered by Upstash Redis sorted set
- Server-side progress persistence: XP, completed stages, and badges synced to Redis on every stage completion
- Cross-device progress restore: logging in on a new device merges server progress with local state
- Cisco epoch now gated — locked until all 12 Foundations stages are completed
- `isEpochUnlocked()` computes epoch access dynamically from progress at render time
- Leaderboard page fetches live data from `/api/leaderboard`; falls back gracefully if offline
- `GET /api/progress` and `POST /api/progress` routes added for progress sync
- Migrated `middleware.ts` → `proxy.ts` (Next.js 16 convention)
- Deleted legacy `CtfTerminal.tsx` (superseded by `CtfChallenge.tsx` since v0.1.0)

## v0.4.1 — 2026-05-10

**Security hardening**

- Admin username removed from source code — moved to server-side env var (`ADMIN_USERNAME`)
- Admin cookie grant now server-side only via signed HMAC token (`ADMIN_SECRET`)
- New API route `/api/admin-session` handles admin cookie issuance and revocation
- Next.js proxy — `/admin/**` routes blocked at the edge without valid HttpOnly cookie
- `isAdmin()` reads from stored user record instead of hardcoded string
- Registration no longer auto-grants admin based on username match
- Admin notification email moved from hardcoded to `ADMIN_EMAIL` env var
- Content Security Policy header added
- Fixed hardcoded admin username display in admin dashboard UI
