**Version:** 2.0

## Core Infrastructure Partners

### Vercel
**Role:** Hosting, CDN, serverless compute  
**Plan:** Hobby (free)  
**URL:** vercel.com  
**Dashboard:** vercel.com/dashboard

Vercel hosts the entire application. Every `git push` to `master` triggers an automatic build and deploy. The Next.js serverless API routes run as Vercel Edge Functions. Assets are served from a global CDN with the primary region in `iad1` (US East, Washington DC).

**What it handles:**
- Static asset delivery (JS, CSS, images)
- Next.js App Router server-side rendering
- Serverless API routes (`/api/*`)
- HTTPS termination and HSTS enforcement
- Custom domain routing (kryptoscronos.com)
- Build pipeline from GitHub push to production

**Limits (Hobby):** 100 GB bandwidth/month, 6,000 build minutes/month, 1 team member  
**Upgrade trigger:** Pro ($20/month) when team members need deploy access or commercial use grows

### Upstash
**Role:** Serverless Redis — leaderboard, progress sync, rate limiting, password reset  
**Plan:** Free tier  
**URL:** upstash.com  
**Dashboard:** console.upstash.com

Upstash provides a globally distributed, REST-accessible Redis instance. It's the backbone of everything server-side in the app: real-time leaderboard rankings, cross-device progress sync, IP-based rate limiting, and time-limited password reset tokens.

**What it handles:**
- Global leaderboard (Redis sorted set, ranked by XP)
- Server-side user progress persistence (Redis hash per user)
- Password reset token storage (with 1-hour TTL)
- Rate limiting for forgot-password (3/IP/15min) and registration notifications (5/IP/hour)
- User record storage (first-write-wins on registration)

**Integration:** `@upstash/redis` npm package, REST API with `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` + `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`  
**Limits (Free):** 10,000 commands/day, 256 MB storage  
**Upgrade trigger:** Pay-as-you-go when daily command volume exceeds free tier

---

### Resend
**Role:** Transactional email delivery  
**Plan:** Free tier (3,000 emails/month)  
**URL:** resend.com  
**Dashboard:** resend.com/dashboard

Resend handles all outbound emails: admin alerts when new users register, and password reset links. It's called from serverless API routes with rate limiting to prevent abuse.

**What it handles:**
- Admin notification when a new user registers (`/api/notify-registration`)
- Password reset emails with time-limited token links (`/api/forgot-password`)

**Integration:** HTTP API calls to `https://api.resend.com` using `RESEND_API_KEY`  
**CSP note:** `connect-src` in `next.config.ts` explicitly allows `https://api.resend.com`  
**Limits (Free):** 3,000 emails/month, 100 emails/day  
**Upgrade trigger:** Pro ($20/month) when email volume grows or custom domain required for deliverability

---

### GitHub
**Role:** Source control, CI trigger  
**Plan:** Free  
**URL:** github.com/jjfleetwood/kryptos-cronos

GitHub is the source of truth for all code. The Vercel GitHub App is connected to the repo — every push to `master` automatically triggers a production deploy. Pull requests trigger preview deployments.

**What it handles:**
- Version control and history
- Automated Vercel deploy trigger on push
- Issue tracking and project management (when used)

**Security note:** GitHub Personal Access Tokens used in CLI commands should be revoked immediately after use. Never store tokens in the repo or shell history permanently.

## AI Development Infrastructure

### Anthropic Claude / Claude Code
**Role:** AI-assisted development environment  
**Usage:** All code in this repository was built with Claude Code as the primary development tool

Claude Code (the Anthropic CLI) was used throughout the entire build sprint — writing components, debugging, architecture decisions, security review, and documentation. The development workflow is: Claude Code as pair programmer + human for product direction and validation.
