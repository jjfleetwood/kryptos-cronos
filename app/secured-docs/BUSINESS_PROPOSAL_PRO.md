## Investor Briefing & Commercial Opportunity
**Confidential — May 2026**

## The Problem

Cybersecurity talent is in structural shortage. There are currently **3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity positions globally** (Cybersecurity Ventures, 2025), and that number is growing faster than any traditional training institution can address. Simultaneously, the threat landscape is accelerating: AI-assisted attacks, zero-day exploits, and state-sponsored intrusions are outpacing the defenders.

Existing training solutions fail on two fronts:

1. **Certification-focused platforms** (CompTIA, ISC²) teach to exams, not to real-world threat response. Completion rates are below 15%.
2. **Enterprise security training** is universally described by employees as compliance theater — checkbox activities with no retention or behavior change.

The result is a workforce that knows *about* security but cannot *do* security.

## The Opportunity

Kryptós CronOS is a **gamified, AI-personalized cybersecurity and AI-safety training platform** targeting three converging markets:

| Market | Size (2025) | CAGR |
|---|---|---|
| Cybersecurity workforce training | $14.8B | 14.2% |
| Enterprise e-learning platforms | $37.9B | 19.6% |
| AI literacy & upskilling | $6.1B | 32.4% |

We are building at the intersection of all three.

## Product

### Core Experience

Kryptós CronOS delivers training through **stage-based missions** that simulate real attacks and real defenses. Each stage follows a four-part structure:

1. **Threat Briefing** — A detailed, technically accurate overview of a vulnerability class: its history, how it works mechanically, and the real-world incident where it caused maximum damage (Target breach, Equifax, WannaCry, Log4Shell, SolarWinds, OPM).

2. **Attack Flow Visualization** — An interactive diagram showing the attacker, the compromised system, the victim, and the outcome. System-generated from structured data, not stock illustrations.

3. **Capture the Flag (CTF) Challenge** — A simulated bash terminal environment where the learner must exploit or investigate the exact vulnerability described in the briefing — replicas of real environments from documented incidents.

4. **ARIA AI Tutor** — A live, stage-aware AI assistant (powered by Claude Haiku) that uses Socratic coaching: it answers questions and guides thinking without giving away the flag. Available throughout every challenge.

### Curriculum — 438 Stages across 36 Epochs and 10 Tracks (v1.12.0)

## Business Model

### B2C (Direct to Learner)
- **Free tier:** Stages 1–3 (acquisition funnel)
- **Pro:** $5.99/month or $55.99/year — full curriculum + AI personalization + badge certificates
- **Team:** $12/seat/month (10+ seats) — cohort dashboards, completion reporting

#### Ad-Supported Hints — Revenue Model Detail

Each stage provides one hint at no cost. Hints 2 and 3 require either a 30-second sponsor ad or a Pro subscription upgrade. Ads are contextually matched to stage content: endpoint detection vendors appear on malware stages; cloud security providers appear on SSRF and misconfiguration stages. This drives premium CPMs ($50–$200) against a verified security practitioner audience.

At 50,000 free users with an average of 0.5 ad impressions per session, projected revenue is approximately $2,500/month, scaling linearly with user growth at zero marginal cost. The hint friction point is the highest-intent moment in the product — every ad impression doubles as a Pro upgrade conversion opportunity.

### B2B (Enterprise)
- **Enterprise:** $8/seat/month (100+ seats) — SSO, compliance reporting, custom curriculum, dedicated success manager
- Target: Fortune 500 security teams, defense contractors, financial services firms under SEC cybersecurity disclosure rules (effective 2024)

### Sponsor Integration (Ecosystem Revenue)
Strategic sponsors — security tools vendors (CrowdStrike, Cisco, SentinelOne), cloud providers (AWS, Azure), and certification bodies (CompTIA, ISC²) — can:
- Sponsor specific stage badges ("Powered by CrowdStrike — Threat Hunter Badge")
- Offer co-branded certificates redeemable for exam discounts
- Run sponsored challenge weeks with custom CTF scenarios
- Access anonymized aggregate learner skill data (with consent) for workforce insights

This creates a tripartite flywheel: learners build skills → employers find certified talent → vendors reach a qualified security audience.

#### Cisco — Flagship Sponsor Integration

Cisco is the deepest planned sponsor relationship, anchored by a 50-stage Cisco curriculum built across 4 epochs (Core CVEs, Enterprise Defense, SecOps, Advanced Defense + Umbrella DNS Security) and expanding across four product lines:

| Integration | Product | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Weekly CVE Challenge | **Cisco Talos** | Talos threat feed drives new CTF scenario weekly — co-branded "Talos Threat of the Week" |
| DNS & Network Security Track | **Cisco Umbrella** | Dedicated epoch: DNS tunneling, DGA, and network policy stages |
| Enterprise SecOps Track | **Cisco SecureX / XDR** | Alert triage and incident response stages modeled on SecureX workflows |
| Network Defense Stages | **Cisco Firepower / NGFW** | Firewall exploitation and lateral movement scenarios |
| Certification Alignment | **Cisco CyberOps Associate** | Cisco epoch completions map to CyberOps exam domains; Cisco provides exam vouchers |
| API Security Track | **Cisco DevNet** | REST API exploitation and OAuth misconfiguration stages |
