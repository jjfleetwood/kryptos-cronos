"""Read-only MCP server — Artificial Intelligence (AI): "AI infra and access security" audit evidence.

THE TEST
Verify AI infrastructure + access are secured. PASS: AI compute, the ML platform, model registry, and data are access-controlled (least-privilege, SSO+MFA, network isolation, hardened); pipeline service identities are scoped + least-privilege; secrets (model-provider API keys, data creds) are vaulted; and model-serving/inference endpoints are authenticated + protected. Exceptions: broad/unrestricted access to models + training data, the ML platform exposed/unhardened, over-privileged pipeline service accounts, hardcoded model-provider API keys, and unauthenticated inference endpoints.

ARTIFACT (what _gather() pulls)
    The security of AI infrastructure (training/inference compute, model registry, ML platform, GPUs) — access control, network isolation, hardening

REAL SOURCES / COMMANDS to wire in place of the fixtures (read-only):
    access control to models + ML platform + training data (least-privilege, SSO/MFA, network isolation)
    AI-pipeline service identities + their permissions (scoped?)
    secrets in AI pipelines: vaulted vs hardcoded (model-provider API keys, data creds)
    inference/serving endpoints: authenticated + protected?

This server gathers the in-scope inventory and the observed control state, evaluates
each item against policy, and reports the exceptions with a PASS / EXCEPTIONS /
MATERIAL-GAP opinion. READ-ONLY: it lists and reports, never changes state — the hard
requirement for audit tooling.
