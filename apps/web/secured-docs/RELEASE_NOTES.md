# Kryptós CronOS — Release Notes

---

## v1.26.0 — 2026-06-03

**Cross-platform: native mobile app, monorepo, mobile billing & analytics**

Building on v1.25.0's bearer-auth backend, this release makes Kryptós CronOS a true cross-platform product.

- **Turborepo monorepo.** Repo restructured into npm workspaces: `apps/web` (the Next.js app + API, deployed by Vercel — was `app/`), `apps/mobile` (Expo / React Native), `packages/core` (`@kryptos/core` — all curriculum content + types, was `app/src/data`), and `packages/api-client` (`@kryptos/api-client` — a framework-agnostic typed API client shared by web + mobile). Vercel Root Directory = `apps/web`; `transpilePackages: ["@kryptos/core"]`.
- **Native mobile app (`apps/mobile`).** Expo SDK 56 + Expo Router client: Supabase login, stage list/detail, quiz play, ARIA hints, upgrade screen. Auths via Supabase JWT bearer against the existing API (`/api/v1`). Shipped via EAS (store submission pending).
- **JWKS bearer verification.** `verifySupabaseJwt()` now verifies tokens locally against the Supabase project JWKS (`jose`) with a `getUser()` fallback — no network round-trip per request. Identity still resolved only from the verified email claim.
- **Versioned `/api/v1/*` namespace** (next.config rewrite → `/api/*`) for the mobile client.
- **Mobile in-app purchases (RevenueCat).** `react-native-purchases` on device + `POST /api/webhooks/revenuecat` (auth-header verified). `app_user_id` = username so it reconciles with Stripe.
- **Multi-source entitlement.** `getUserTier()` now grants Pro if any of `proStripe` (web), `rcProExpiry` (mobile IAP), or `voucherExpiry` is active, and downgrades only when none remain — so one platform's webhook can't strip access granted by another.
- **Push notifications.** `POST/DELETE /api/push/register` (Expo push tokens in `push:tokens`) + `GET /api/push/streak-reminder` Vercel Cron (daily streak-at-risk nudge, `CRON_SECRET`-guarded).
- **Single-branch workflow.** The `dev` branch was retired; `master` is the single deploy source (CI from the monorepo root; risky changes use a short-lived feature branch + Vercel Preview).
- **Plausible analytics** — privacy-friendly, cookieless, no PII; allowlisted in the `proxy.ts` nonce CSP.
- New env vars: `REVENUECAT_WEBHOOK_AUTH`, `CRON_SECRET`. Mobile uses `apps/mobile/.env` (`EXPO_PUBLIC_*`).

## v1.25.0 — 2026-06-03

**Mobile roadmap Phase 1: multi-client token auth (backend)**

- **Bearer-token auth on the API.** New `getAuthedUsername()` resolver (`src/lib/api-auth.ts`) accepts an `Authorization: Bearer <supabase-jwt>` (for mobile clients) and falls back to the existing HMAC `session_token` cookie (web). The legacy sync `getServerSession()` is unchanged for SSR pages. This is the keystone that lets a phone talk to the existing backend.
- **JWT verification** (`src/lib/supabase-jwt.ts`) via the official `supabaseAdmin.auth.getUser(token)` — algorithm-agnostic across Supabase's symmetric→asymmetric key migration. **Identity is resolved from the token's verified top-level `email` claim → the `email:{email}` reverse index, NOT from `user_metadata.username`** (which is user-editable and would allow account takeover).
- **`POST /api/auth/bootstrap`** — provisions a Redis user record for Supabase-only (mobile-registered) accounts that never hit `/api/auth/register`. Idempotent; keys the account to the verified email and enforces username uniqueness on first claim (atomic `SET NX` on the email binding).
- **16 gameplay/user-data routes migrated** to `getAuthedUsername` (progress, quiz-progress, check-flag, check-answer, hint, trophies, shop, skin, user-group, redeem, survey, resume, delete-account, auth/me, downloads/check, progress/certificate). Admin and Stripe routes intentionally unchanged.
- **CORS for `/api`** in `proxy.ts` — origin-allowlisted (production + localhost/Expo dev), credential-less (cross-origin clients use bearer tokens, not cookies), with `OPTIONS` preflight handling. Disallowed origins are not reflected.
- No new env vars; no user-facing change. Verified live: preflight returns 204 + correct CORS headers, bogus bearer tokens are rejected (401), disallowed origins are not reflected.

## v1.24.0 — 2026-06-03

**AI cloud certifications: AWS AI Practitioner + Google Cloud Professional ML Engineer**

- **Two new certificate paths on `/certs`** — AWS Certified AI Practitioner (AIF-C01) and Google Cloud Professional Machine Learning Engineer (PMLE). Brings the tracked-cert count to ten (plus the CyberOps Associate tracker).
- **AWS Certified AI Practitioner (AIF-C01)** — 5 official domains (AI/ML Fundamentals 20%, Generative AI 24%, Foundation Models 28%, Responsible AI 14%, AI Security & Governance 14%); rose card. Mapped to 49 AI-native stages: all MITRE ATLAS (atlas-01..12), all OWASP LLM (llm-01..12), all Emerging Tech (emerging-01..10), all Agentic AI audit (audit-a01..a12), plus Cisco AI-security stages m42/m43/m50.
- **Google Cloud Professional ML Engineer (PMLE)** — 6 official domains (Low-Code 13%, Data & Model Mgmt 14%, Scaling 18%, Serving 20%, Pipelines 22%, Monitoring 13%); green card. Mapped to ~33 ML-lifecycle stages across ATLAS/LLM/Emerging plus the agentic + continuous-monitoring audit stages.
- **Implementation** — new `aws-aip`/`gcp-pmle` `CertId`s with domain defs + builder fns in `cert-domains.ts`; mappings live in a self-contained `AI_PLATFORM_CERT_DOMAINS` table merged into `CERT_DOMAINS` at module load (additive — leaves the existing security-cert table untouched). Quantum/crypto and pure-security stages intentionally excluded so the readiness rings stay credible.
- **Practice exams auto-populate** — both certs draw question pools from their mapped stages' quizzes via `getStagesForCert`; allowlisted in `api/exam/route.ts` and `exam/cert/[certId]/page.tsx`. No new API routes, Redis keys, or env vars.
- Cards use rose (AWS) and green (Google) rather than brand orange/blue to avoid clashing with the existing CySA+ (orange) and Network+ (blue) cards.

## v1.23.0 — 2026-05-30

**Every CTF stage is now dual-mode (Quiz + CTF) + brand & homepage refresh**

- **Dual-mode quiz rollout — COMPLETE (203/203 CTF stages).** Every `challengeType: "ctf"` stage now ships an 8-question multiple-choice `stage.quiz` alongside its CTF, so learners can choose Quiz mode (cosmetic half-clear, 0 XP, no unlock) or CTF mode (full clear). This release authored and shipped the final 69 stages: quantum-3 (QKD, c01–c10), quantum-4 (quantum risk mgmt, d01–d10), cisco-2 (m13–m25), cisco-3 (m26/m28/m30), cisco-4 (m34/m36/m37), cisco-5 (m39/m41/m42/m44/m46/m48/m50), umbrella (01–10), and the ancient foundations set in stages.ts (stage-01–12 + stage-m12). Each quiz is grounded in the stage's real content + the `ctf-quiz-data.json` fact bank, authored via the idempotent `scripts/inject-quizzes.mjs` injector.
- **New brand logo** — replaced the 🛡️ emoji with a guilloché watch-dial mark (`Logo.tsx`): cyan→indigo gradient hands reading 4:21, dark-purple outer ring + cyan bezel, 60 minute ticks and a 6-o'clock subdial. Applied in Nav, footer, login, onboarding, and as the favicon (`icon.svg`). Uses `gradientUnits="userSpaceOnUse"` so gradients paint correctly on line elements.
- **Playable homepage hero** — `HomeCtfDemo.tsx`: an interactive mini-CTF terminal (ls → cat vault.lock → submit FLAG{…}) with a `hint` command and suggestion chips, replacing the static terminal animation. Success CTA routes to /login.
- **Certs page UX** — added a sticky left-sidebar jump-nav (like /admin), made CyberOps the first/featured card, widened to `max-w-6xl`, and moved the Resume builder link into a "Career" section in the certs menu (removed from the top nav).
- **Content formatting** — `RichText.tsx` now renders backtick `` `code` `` as cyan monospace pills and `'single-quoted'` terms as restrained amber pills; `RichParagraph` lead colors chilled (sky/pink at 80% opacity). Briefing-section reformat to bulleted-with-dialogue begun on tech-audit-3 (audit-a07, audit-a01).

---

## v1.17.0 — 2026-05-29

**Security hardening — OWASP Top 10 audit + voucher system fixes**

- **Voucher fixes** — admin voucher routes now require HMAC `admin_token` (was session-only); redeem race condition fixed (SADD atomic dedup + optimistic HINCRBY with rollback on negative); Stripe webhook (`subscription.deleted`) clears `voucherExpiry` to prevent downgrade conflict; revoke endpoint (`PATCH /api/admin/vouchers`) + Revoke button in admin panel; account page shows voucher expiry for voucher-based Pro users; 365-day duration + 500-use limit options added

- Security briefing updated to v4.1

---

## v1.16.3 — 2026-05-29

**Admin left nav (fixed sidebar) + anchor IDs + voucher list no-flicker**

- **Admin dashboard** — fixed left-nav sidebar always visible (was collapsible); all major sections given anchor IDs (`#users`, `#vouchers`, `#metrics`, `#audit`, `#docs`) for direct deep-linking from other pages
- **Voucher list** — no-flicker on page refresh (SSR-safe hydration pattern; was causing client/server mismatch)

---

## v1.16.2 — 2026-05-29

**Voucher code system — admin generate, user redeem, ProPaywall input**

- **Voucher system** — `KRYPTOS-XXXX-XXXX` format codes (8 alphanumeric, avoids O/0/I/1 confusion); admin generate batch (1–50 codes, configurable uses/duration); `POST /api/redeem` for user redemption
- **Atomic redemption** — SADD to `voucher:redeemers:{CODE}` set for per-user dedup (returns 0 if duplicate); HINCRBY to decrement `usesLeft` with rollback if result goes negative (race condition safe); sets `tier: pro` + `voucherExpiry` timestamp on user hash
- **Admin voucher panel** — list all codes with uses/redeemers/expiry; generate form; revoke button
- **ProPaywall** — redeem input field for voucher codes; calls `/api/redeem` before Stripe fallback
- **`getUserTier()`** — checks `voucherExpiry` timestamp; returns `free` if expired, `pro` if active

---

## v1.16.0 — 2026-05-28

**Security/Non-Security sections, full i18n, Paris/Milan images, survey, downloads page, back link fix, admin UX**

- **Stages page** — Security (🔒) and Non-Security (📚) section headers divide the track list; Downloads link (↓ Python Downloads) in the Security header links to `/downloads`
- **`/downloads` page** — lists all 24 Python MCP server templates with descriptions and individual download links, grouped by epoch
- **`/survey` page** — 9-question user survey (referral, security level, valuable tracks, missing content, NPS, upgrade reason, role, time/week, open comments); `POST /api/survey` persists to Redis sorted set (`survey:index`)
- **i18n — section themes** — Attack Chain / Technical Deep-Dive / Real-World Incident (and all 7 category variants) now use translation keys; added to all 6 language files (fr/es/de/hi/pt/pl)
- **i18n — FeedbackWidget** — all visible strings (title, placeholder, hint, send/sent/failed/sending, expand/minimize) now use `useLocale()`; translated in all 6 languages. "Full survey →" link added.
- **AttackDiagram** — `category` prop added; ATTACKER/SYSTEM/TARGET/RESULT labels replaced with STEP N for non-security stages (arts, travel, driving, health) and category-specific labels for sports
- **RichText** — `context` prop: `"general"` mode disables CVE/SQL/acronym/file-path/IP/port highlights for non-security content (arts, travel, sports, driving, health stages)
- **Overview section** — `boldLead=false` removes the bold lead sentence; overview is now one consistent font. Lead color darkened: sky-400 / pink-400 (was sky-200 / pink-200)
- **Module title** — stage title links to `#real-world` anchor on the incident/cultural context section
- **BackLink fix** — `StageContainer` now passes `backHref` to `StageInfo`; back button always returns to epoch page (was unreliable with `router.back()` on direct URL visits)
- **Admin page** — username column widened (1fr → 3fr in grid template); `truncate` removed, `break-all` added; long usernames no longer clip
- **Paris images** — stages 9–20 given Wikimedia Commons images: Luxembourg Gardens, Notre-Dame, Sainte-Chapelle, Place des Vosges, Bastille column, Belleville, Galerie Vivienne, Père Lachaise, Marché d'Aligre, Canal Saint-Martin, Versailles, Sacré-Cœur

- **content-flags.ts** — added missing epochs: cisco-advanced, paris-july, milan-july, french-basics, italian-basics
- **Certificate route** — try/catch around `renderToBuffer` with 500 response on failure for easier debugging
- **Docs updated** — BUSINESS_PROPOSAL_PRO/CASUAL, PITCH_TARGETS, FINANCIALS: corrected pricing ($13.99/mo, $99/yr), stage counts (438), version (v1.15.1→v1.16.0), added adaptive difficulty + CyberOps tracker + 7-day trial to live features; Supabase status → complete
- **TODO.md** — new deferred items: elementary redesign (A), incentives system (B), certificate paths (C), resume module (D), all-stage images (E), docs final update (F)

---

## v1.15.1 — 2026-05-28

**Stage briefing paragraph formatting — bold lead sentence**

- `RichParagraph` component splits each paragraph at first sentence boundary; lead sentence rendered bold + light blue (`text-sky-200`) in overview/technical sections, bold + light pink (`text-pink-200`) in incident sections — acts as a scannable topic sentence for each paragraph
- Reverted previous question-highlight and parenthetical-green approaches
- Applied to overview, technical deep-dive, and real-world incident body paragraphs across all 438 stages

---

## v1.15.0 — 2026-05-28

**Supabase Auth migration — parallel auth with zero-downtime PBKDF2 fallback**

- New `src/lib/supabase.ts` — `supabaseAdmin` (service role client) + `createSupabaseServerClient()` (SSR session reader) + `getSupabaseUsername()`
- **Register:** new accounts simultaneously written to Redis (PBKDF2) and Supabase Auth (`email_confirm: true`, `user_metadata.username`)
- **Login:** tries Supabase `signInWithPassword` first; on failure falls back to PBKDF2 and transparently creates a Supabase account (silent migration — no user action required)
- **Logout:** signs out from both Supabase and clears HMAC session cookie
- **Forgot-password:** triggers both Supabase `resetPasswordForEmail` and the existing Resend custom email
- **Reset-password:** after Redis PBKDF2 update, syncs new password to Supabase via service role
- All existing API routes, sessions, and the HMAC cookie system unchanged — zero breaking changes
- Packages: `@supabase/supabase-js@2.106.2`, `@supabase/ssr@0.10.3`

**Adaptive difficulty engine — XP bonus, skill tracking, smart hints, recommended next**

- **`src/lib/difficulty.ts`** — new server-only engine: `computeStageScore` (time + hints + attempts → 0–100), `computeBonusXp` (+20% at score ≥ 80), `adaptiveCooldownSeconds` (Pro ARIA: 0s/15s/30s by skill), `getRecommendedNext` (harder or easier incomplete stage by skill), Redis helpers for rolling skill level and per-stage signal counters (`diff:<user>:level`, `diff:<user>:history`, `diff:<user>:hints:<stageId>`, `diff:<user>:attempts:<stageId>`)
- **XP bonus** — clean/fast solves (score ≥ 80) earn +20% coins; shown as `⚡ Clean solve bonus: +N 🪙` in the CTF terminal and a yellow badge in FlagSuccessModal; tracked in Redis `bonus` field; included in leaderboard delta
- **Skill level** — rolling average of last 10 stage scores (0–100) stored in Redis; defaults to 50; updated after every CTF flag and quiz final answer
- **Wrong attempt tracking** — `INCR diff:<user>:attempts:<stageId>` on every wrong flag submission or quiz answer; 48 h TTL
- **Hint usage tracking** — `INCR diff:<user>:hints:<stageId>` after every ARIA response; feeds into stage score
- **Adaptive ARIA cooldown (Pro)** — skill < 40 → 0 s, skill 40–69 → 15 s, skill ≥ 70 → 30 s; returned as `nextCooldownS` in hint API; free tier unchanged at 30 s; updated banner copy reflects adaptive behavior
- **Recommended Next** — returned in check-flag response; shown as cyan card above action buttons in FlagSuccessModal; harder stage (higher XP) for skill ≥ 60, easier for skill < 60
- **Stages visibility fix** — `career` and `curious` `GROUP_EPOCHS` now mirror each other; users with either group stored in Redis see the full career + extended curriculum (fixes accounts registered with `curious` only)
- **ESLint fix** — data merge scripts (`src/data/**/*.js`) added to `globalIgnores` in `eslint.config.mjs`; 0 errors maintained
