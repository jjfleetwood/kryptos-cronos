"""Read-only MCP server — Vulnerability & Patch Management: "Red and blue teaming" audit evidence.

THE TEST
Assess the red/blue/purple program. PASS: adversary-emulation exercises run on cadence against realistic ATT&CK techniques with proper RoE; blue-team detection/response is measured (what was detected, MTTD/MTTR); a purple-team matrix shows technique coverage; and findings are remediated and retested. Exceptions: no adversary emulation, tests not mapped to ATT&CK, detections that silently failed and weren't fixed, and findings with no retest.

ARTIFACT (what _gather() pulls)
    The red-team engagement reports with scope and rules of engagement (RoE)

REAL SOURCES / COMMANDS to wire in place of the fixtures (read-only):
    MITRE Caldera or Atomic Red Team to execute techniques safely
    for each executed technique, correlate to a SIEM/EDR alert: detected vs missed
    build an ATT&CK Navigator coverage layer from the results
    track each finding to closure with retest evidence

This server gathers the in-scope inventory and the observed control state, evaluates
each item against policy, and reports the exceptions with a PASS / EXCEPTIONS /
MATERIAL-GAP opinion. READ-ONLY: it lists and reports, never changes state — the hard
requirement for audit tooling.
