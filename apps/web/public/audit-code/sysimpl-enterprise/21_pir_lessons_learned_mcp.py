"""Read-only MCP server — System Implementation — Enterprise: "PIR / lessons learned" audit evidence.

THE TEST
Verify the program is closed with a real PIR + benefits check. PASS: a formal PIR assesses objectives/scope/budget/schedule outcome, benefits are measured against business-case KPIs with owners, lessons learned feed the methodology/knowledge base, and outstanding issues + technical debt are handed to BAU with owners. Exceptions: no PIR (no honest accounting of the outcome), benefits never measured (success assumed), lessons-learned never captured or reused, and open issues/tech debt abandoned at project close with no owner.

ARTIFACT (what _gather() pulls)
    The post-implementation review (a formal PIR after stabilisation: did it meet objectives/scope/budget/schedule, benefits realised vs business case, what worked + what didn't)

REAL SOURCES / COMMANDS to wire in place of the fixtures (read-only):
    formal PIR after stabilisation (objectives/scope/budget/schedule outcome; what worked/didn't)
    benefits realisation vs business-case KPIs (actual outcome, owned + reported)
    lessons learned fed into methodology/knowledge base
    outstanding-issue + technical-debt register handed to BAU with owners

This server gathers the in-scope inventory and the observed control state, evaluates
each item against policy, and reports the exceptions with a PASS / EXCEPTIONS /
MATERIAL-GAP opinion. READ-ONLY: it lists and reports, never changes state — the hard
requirement for audit tooling.
